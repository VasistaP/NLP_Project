3,"here's the full article without blocks. ""atlanta — stanlecia johnson, 48, registered to vote when she turned 18 years old, but almost immediately lost the right when she was convicted of a felony around the same time. she did not vote for 30 years. but after registering again last month, johnson plans to vote in fulton county in november. johnson is one of over 40,000 voters who have reregistered this year ahead of georgia’s oct. 7 deadline. most of them last updated their registration after vice president kamala harris joined the race, with roughly 25% doing so on the day of her july rally in atlanta, according to an atlanta journal-constitution analysis of the state’s voter roll. “she seems like a strong woman,” johnson said. “it seems like she’s for the people, for my people, regular people.” the georgia secretary of state removed thousands of voter registrations before the beginning of the year for varying reasons — some were removed for not voting or responding to mail from election officials in two general election cycles, others were deleted following a conviction with a felony sentence, and still others for moving to another state. now, many of these voters are eligible again and back on georgia’s voter roll. in the same period of time, the state has removed more than 100,000 names from georgia’s list of eligible voters. death and duplicate entries are the two main reasons for removal so far this year. “this maintenance isn’t evil,” said mitchell brown, a political scientist at auburn university. “it’s good administrative practice.” brown said the timing of the updated registrations could reflect increased interest in harris as a candidate or coincide with more outreach to voters around that time. lauren groh-wargo, ceo of voting rights organization fair fight action, interpreted the reregistrations as a sign that there is strong enthusiasm to vote this year, especially among the 60% of reregistrants who had been inactive in georgia’s elections for several years. “these folks were registered before. they didn’t vote for a set of years,” she said. “they decided to vote again, but they had to take that additional step and burden of reregistering.” this burden of reregistering is made easier by voter outreach by organizations like women on the rise, which is dedicated to empowering formerly incarcerated women. they reached out to johnson and informed her of her right to vote. greater georgia, a republican-led effort, said that it reaches out to voters who have not participated in elections for a long time. these voters might include those who were removed from the rolls for inactivity. “it’s not just first-time voters who are getting involved this cycle,” said caitlin o’dea, spokesperson for greater georgia in a statement. “after making over 100,000 phone calls, we’ve helped reregister many georgians who haven’t voted in decades.” a voter’s registration can be updated when moving counties, getting married and changing last names, or renewing a driver’s license. some voters listed as updating their registration in july may have reregistered earlier in the year, and then made one of these smaller changes later on. that was the case for alan overton. the 58-year-old had lived in georgia before and reregistered after moving back to the state from florida in january. when he settled in and relocated to cobb county over the summer, he updated his registration again. overton said he has been voting for 30 years and that his primary motivation is to stop former president donald trump from regaining power. he also said that harris represents an opportunity for change. “a return to intelligence, a return to logic, a return to responsibility to your neighbors, a return to inclusiveness,” he said. “all these things that we just sort of took for granted when i was growing up.” [",2
5,and trump even after 4 years as president has never detailed any policy specifics. it’s just “we will stop inflation!” ok how? “by deporting millions of people at once!” ok how you gonna do that? “kamala is so bad she destroyed our country it’s like a third world country it’s a disgrace. you can’t even buy bacon” cut to fox news lauding trump for actually “taking questions” who cares if he didn’t *answer* them,0
171,"that's awesome! my dad is a hardcore trump supporter and my grandma is not at all. the other day he was fuming because she said that she's voting for kamala because she has a vagina and marjorie taylor green is a piece of shit.

3,"i'm voting for harris, but i'm not sure that an endorsement from one of the worst mass murderers in us history would make me feel better about it. as bad as trump is, w bush & dick cheney killed more than 2,000,000 people in pointless military adventures, and also legalized torture. they are on a whole other level of bad than trump is.",0

158,"that was a master class by kamala, holy fuck. she knew the comment about his crowds was going to get under his skin. then he goes completely off the rails (as he has for nearly the last decade) and she takes the moment to just.....speak directly to the american people about how he doesn't care about you, and he only cares for himself. fuck yes. well played.",1

8,midwest is the same. no one will admit to publicly voting harris or put sign in yards. more due to the hassel they would get from trumpers.,2
39,"yeah both friends last night i talked with admitted that trump wasn't an effective policy maker. that he wasn't a good person. they think he was a lifelong democrat who only recently became a republican. they think he is a money fairy and agreed that his ideas and giving away money would create inflation. but they think kamala is a marxist, and are convinced her father was. and i know one will vote for trump, and the other is mostly that way. there was a lot of pushback on numbers, figures, estimates, models, and the like from the more contrarian trump supporter. i showed some estimates of policies costs, and it was like they didn't believe the non-partisan group could even make estimates on policies. i think the fact that trump has lied, said outrageous things, and been checked by congress and his own staff has led into delusion and nihilism that anything can be anchored to reality. like how everyone in oil & gas knows when he says that he will cut gas prices in half that he doesn't have that ability as president, and if he did it would be a disaster for their jobs and businesses, but still you have a large number supporting him because they just know that he tells lies to the public and has no real policies. and that they can use him. nothing he says it to be believes so my friend can totally dismiss any estimate about how this stuff may affect the economy, because it is fantasy.",0
1897,"> the harris campaign did not immediately respond to questions about the vice president’s comments or how long she has been a gun owner. reuters noted she said she was a skilled shooter during an interview with politico in 2015. she added at the time she had shot a gun “many times.” >she also told reporters in 2019 that she owned a gun. “i own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety,” she said at the time. “i was a career prosecutor.” she talked about this way before today. it’s not new.",2
7,he had somewhat stroke face during the harris debate. i noticed his right eye being a bit smushy,2

3,"terrible decision by harris. you aren't going to sway any republicans, and moderates/undecided voters aren't going to watch it. all she will do is give republicans more firepower against her. if she answers poorly, it might even convince some would be dem voters to sit at home instead. just overall terrible",0

86,is comey gonna come out two weeks before the election and open an investigation into harris?,2

11,"i don't understand. trump's rally attendance is down. harris packs hers, even filling up two to the brime during the dnc. she crushed him in the debate, is receiving a record amount in small donors, has a much better ground game, and is now even closing the gap in red states. how the fuck is this election still so damn close?",1

5,swing state voter from wisconsin and we voted harris and blue down ticket. anecdotally i have seen far fewer trump signs in the hinterland than in previous years and a surprisingly good amount of harris signs. slightly hopeful here in wisco but understand the anxiety. apologies from this american that we let it get this far into a right wing fever dream.,0
275,> kamala isn't pulling punches and i think that is really rattling donald here. i can't imagine what must be going on at mar-a-lago after a black woman publicly accused trump of being a coward. they're probably hiding his phone from him so he can't post some truly campaign-ending shit on truth social.,0

398,"hold on, when we put it together it's really easy to see why this is a close race. reasons to vote against donald trump: * convicted of 34 felonies, and facing multiple ongoing criminal trials * close associate of jeffrey epstein * was found to have raped e. jean carroll by a jury. the jury found him liable of sexual assault, but the facts they accepted to reach that conclusion would meet the common definition of rape. * both trump and his vp candidate have supported project 2025 and have close ties to its backers. * trump likely received millions of dollars in illegal donations from the egyptian government, but barr shut down the investigation reasons to vote against kamala harris: * wore a tan suit * eats doritos * laughs * made trump sad when she replaced biden as the candidate * while running for office in california, received a donation from a man who was later convicted of 34 felonies (and counting)",0

4,headline should be: - harris is hosting a town hall - cbs confirmed that trump chickened out weeks ago,0
4,ok that's crazy. i don't put weight in endorsements this late in the election other than to get out the vote and general voting day awareness but the amount of old school republicans coming out for kamala is notable.,2
55,"the most likely scenario is (d) republicans keep running the maga playbook long after trump is dead, and it works pretty well for them, because it gets them to a coin flip in the electoral college for the presidency and keeps them in control of the house and senate most of the time. with the supreme court secured until the second half of the 21st century, there is no reason for republicans to ever act sane. harris isn’t looking good in pa. i don’t think a lot of democrats have really accepted that a second trump term is still a strong possibility. and cheney is in the extreme minority of both the official republican party, and gop voters more broadly. the vast majority of both groups like trump and are fine with maga.",0

6,"things have to get bad enough for revolution before anything will actually change here. it hasn't happened in putin's russia yet, so we have a ways to go, still. it's nice that harris wants to raise the minimum wage, but it's a favorite democrat talking point, and $15 isn't enough anymore, anyway. if it happens, i certainly won't complain about it, but dems are just as beholden to the corporate oligarchy as rs, which is why their overall economic policy is still a strictly conservative one.",2

1567,"like many of you, i watched the debate tonight. if you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. as a voter, i make sure to watch and read everything i can about their proposed policies and plans for this country. recently i was made aware that ai of ‘me’ falsely endorsing donald trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. it really conjured up my fears around ai, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. it brought me to the conclusion that i need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. the simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. i will be casting my vote for kamala harris and tim walz in the 2024 presidential election. i’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes i believe need a warrior to champion them. i think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and i believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. i was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for lgbtq+ rights, ivf, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades. i’ve done my research, and i’ve made my choice. your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. i also want to say, especially to first time voters: remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! i also find it’s much easier to vote early. i’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story. with love and hope, taylor swift childless cat lady",1

20,"this short campaign only works because harris is using biden-harris’s campaign infrastructure. part of the reason why it takes so long in america is because you have to built infrastructure in all 50 states. there has to be a fully staffed “biden for america” office, including renting the office, hiring the staff and organizers, buying computers and office supplies and desks and chairs, and fundraising to get the money to do that… that has to happen 50 times over again. because every single state has two different elections (primary and general) that all have different rules, due dates, procedures, etc. no one seriously stepped up to challenge harris because it just wouldn’t have been possible to build the campaign infrastructure in this short of time",2

23,">some 80% of democratic voters said they viewed biden favorably, compared to 91% who said the same of harris. three quarters of democratic voters said they agreed with a statement that the party and voters should get behind harris now, with only a quarter saying multiple candidates should compete for the party's nomination. when voters in the survey were shown a hypothetical ballot that included independent presidential candidate robert f. kennedy jr., harris led trump 42% to 38%, an advantage outside the margin of error. kennedy, favored by 8% of voters in the poll, has yet to qualify for the ballot in many states ahead of the nov. 5 election. damn this is all so good to read. this also shows that kennedy is cutting trump's support while barely scratching kamala's. the energy and excitement is so palpable right now, and trump's newest attack ad is really not going to do any damage at all (""kamala was secretly hiding joe's infirmities and was acting as a shadow president over the past 3 years..."" oh noes!!). her numbers are going to continue to swing up now that we have a young, strong candidate who can prosecute the case against trump's crazy nonsense and give us a nice clear division between the future of our country vs. trump's christian nationalist authoritarian nonsense. all of the potential vp picks are amazeballs, and all the oxygen in the room has been taken up by kamala.",1
3,"it isn't a black and white thing. flip flop a lot at a high level will make policy making difficult since it is a long and tedious process - and in some cases it may just be the leader talking before they have had time to fully understand a situation/haven't given enough thought. it is good to have someone stick to some general vision/campaign promises. kamala has it a rougher since she has been the vp: so she would be held at a higher standard. on the other hand, trump has it easy since i think even die hard supporters don't exactly value him for his experience or intelligence. imo it should be more like: ""hey, we have tried this thing for 2 years, here are the problems we ran into and things we have done in an attempt to address this. this does not seem to be working according to these stats in accordance with the goals we have set, so based on what we have learned we are going to use this other approach instead"".",1

60,"according to the trump supporters i know, harris is too dumb to string together a single sentence and it's a marvel that she is even able to operate on the level of a human being in her day to day existence. yet somehow she also simultaneously masterminded a palace coup to take biden's spot on the ticket and is in the process of masterminding an enormous amount of election fraud that will be so good that it will leave absolutely zero evidence. i'm really worried that the cognitive dissonance is going to totally break their brains.",0

3,"you are right, you are not an political strategy expert. neither am i, but i do consult in political crisis management in a eu country on the side as an ex-news-journalist. here is my take on your idea: that would very likely turn out to be a bad idea. in essence, in a high level campaign like this, you are always trying to get too much messaging out in too little time or too small audiences. basically, you and your candidate need to decide on how every waking minute until election day is spend most wisely. and thats not just public speaking. when harris is not standing somewhere talking to audiences or potential donors, there is two things she is most likely doing: - taking calls that are prepared by her team - taking breaks from speaking and moving to counter overexertion - other human stuff like eating, sleeping, etc., all tightly controlled and planed, be sure of that now, you cannot plan everything ahead. basically you most likely have a mix of pre-planed stuff and purposefully flexible time slots, to be decided in daily and weekly meetings - in times of crisis even hourly short meetings and group calls. there is likely a small number of people simply preparing pros and cons to various ideas by guessing how effective of a use of her time they would be. and those individuals would look at a spontanous call into fox news like this: - high risk, difficult to prepare for - wrong target audience - good for social media - unlikely to sway undecideds, some risk of actually swaying them against her because its unpresidential to act like that, which for some target audiences is important alltogether, i'd guess thats a hard no from that team, which i guess they would tell harris, too. and there is no reason or personal history with fn for her to decide against that advice, even though that of course is her right.",1

16,"i'm always wrong about everything, but i feel like this is going to be a reagan-level blowout. once biden dropped out it was a done deal. the media is trying to shove the horse race narrative down our throats but i just don't believe it for a second. harris and walz have very little baggage and they're just palling around the country kissing babies and racking up celebrity endorsements and being generally unproblematic. meanwhile, trump is sweaty and disheveled and oranger than i've ever seen him and hasn't spoken in a complete sentence in months. when i was at work recently a customer brought up politics and she told me that she is a republican, and she went to school for political science and got her dream job as a republican political consultant of some sort during the obama administration. then she started crying and told me that trump was making all republicans look insane and it was destroying her career and her life. i don't think this election is about trying to win over a couple percent of undecided voters. i think it's going to be a referendum on trump and the democrats are going to vote against him and some republicans are going to vote against him and women, and puerto ricans, and lebron james, and vendors he never paid back and his previous running mate, and probably even melania would have voted against him if he hadn't been literally watching her to make sure. trump has spent decades pissing americans off individually and in large groups and i think it's finally going to catch up with him.",0

340,"it continues. six days ago, *the new york times* [ran a story]( under the headline “inside the worst three weeks of donald trump’s 2024 campaign.” usually, when the country’s most important newspaper runs a story like that, the candidate pays a little attention and the ship begins to right itself. but in this case, it’s just gotten worse. the ship is capsizing, and the captain is losing his marbles. right after that story ran, trump came out with his wild accusation that kamala harris’s crowd of thousands at a detroit airplane hangar was fake. the next night, he did that weird, to borrow an au courant word, interview with elon musk, where he made more wtf comments than i can recount, capped by his vow to move to venezuela (a country ruled by a corrupt autocrat who just cheated massively in this month’s election) if he loses. on wednesday, he gave a rambling speech at a north carolina rally. then, on thursday, we had a little taste of some [peak trump crazy]( he claimed harris is responsible for [a law in california]( that says [it’s ok to steal]( from a grocery store as long as your take is under $950. (this is not what the [law says]( he made strange comments about cheerios. he lectured jews (at a later event) about how if the democrats win, jewish people “don’t have a chance” in america, [saying of harris]( husband is jewish—that “she doesn’t like jewish people. you know it, i know it, and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.” and we can’t forget the assertion that more than 100 percent of recent u.s. jobs have gone to migrants. meanwhile, what else is harris doing? starting to unveil an economic package that, so far anyway, looks pretty great. it’s aimed straight at middle-class voters and focused on housing and grocery prices. you can’t get more kitchen table than that. and the bit about [going after corporate price gougers]( is great. it sends a nice populist signal that she’s willing to make some enemies. we’re coming up on a month now of harris being the candidate. that isn’t much time, granted, and of course the race is still in margin-of-error territory and at some point but all that said, the harris campaign has been as shrewd as any presidential campaign i’ve ever seen. her stump speech is excellent. the choice of walz was great—their personal chemistry is so evident in that video they just released of the two of them chatting about spicy food and whatnot (the right is trying to gin up outrage over walz saying he eats “white-guy tacos”). the focus on family economics recognizes a potential harris weak spot and establishes the campaign as not being out of touch. they just haven’t done one thing wrong yet.",0

27,one of swift/beyonce endorsing harris right before the debate would be the best case scenario this weekend. early enough to grab the spotlight and attention onto the debate. and big early enough for young voters to have access to early voting ballots and check their registrations before its too late. the other endorsing harris at the end of september for another surge in mail in ballots and early voting. and then have one or both play out harris on stage to a rally a week before voting closes to remind everyone again to go vote. that would be a perfect world scenario.,2

28,"i mean, i think it’s a reflection of just how focused american politics is on “smearing the other guy” instead of having frank discussions on the ways, means, and whys behind various proposed policy it’s all just one giant mudslinging contest 90% of the time, and what this leads to is this mentality of “that guy is *the fucking devil*, because *reasons*!!!1!”, without any care for whether the ‘issue’ being pushed by partisan media is anything worth actually caring about, or even so much as factually true, and so they put a lot of headspace into just “voting for the other guy” but that means that when you pull the rug out from under a candidate that everyone expected to be on the ballot, all that emotional investment in hating ‘the other guy’ (eg biden in this case) goes away. this then leaves them in a place where they’ve *heard* a lot of negative things about ‘their’ candidate (eg trump), but nothing negative about the *new* ‘other guy’ (harris) on account of not having had the time for ‘their’ candidate to build up a good head of steam regarding whatever perceived flaws they can convince everyone they have. — it’s why i don’t give a lot of credence to the ‘suddenly large lead’ harris supposedly has. it’ll bounce back the other way again the more trump and the republican leadership run their mouths. even if it means they have to complain about tan suits again.",0

15,"just a thought but this is very heavily set by congress. the dol can adjust salary thresholds much more easily than minimum wage because it was given that authority. minimum wage authority still rests with congress, so harris would need a pretty amicable congress to get this passed. which is another reason why it hasn’t been adjusted given the current congressional divide. also a good example of why people need to vote down ballot and not just expect the president to be able to do everything (this comment isn’t aimed at you. just in general)",0

43,">“the american fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. they use every opportunity to impugn democracy. they use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism. they cultivate hate and distrust of both britain and russia. they claim to be superpatriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the constitution. they demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.” - henry wallace, us vice president, 1944",1

139,it was good for the same reason kamala wanted the mics to stay live the whole time. trump becomes unhinged when he’s baited and she wanted everyone to see that. letting him get the last word in was very rarely to his benefit and generally played into what she wanted all along. “never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake”. -napoleon bonaparte,0
198,i saw speculation that no one wanted him to endorse her to be able to dump her too. it would track with what aoc said about people that wanted biden out didn't want harris either. i wonder if joe remembered what happened in 2020 when democrats quickly rallied behind him in the primaries. we win when we band together. he had to know the infighting would be the death of us with so little time to the convention. and here we sit now feeling as unified as ever.,1
27,"i remember this coming up when hilary was running. so much criticism was about her talking like a robot. she later acknowledged that - she was so overly coached, overly media trained, that it made her somebody difficult to relate to. i suspect harris went through something similar, as do other female politicians. they get policed on their verbal skills, tone, pitch, to a degree that men don't. with kamala, it definitely feels like she's more natural these days",2

31,"absolutely true! i think he was emboldened by running against another old. white man especially after robert hur's report. and the debate sealed it i'm sure in trump's (and maga republicans) minds, that's why they were so giddy and ""unified"" at the rnc. but now that he's actually running against kamala harris he doesn't know what to do! i'm sure he regrets picking jd vance as his running mate, who only seems to make things worse as far as his own radical gaffes and opinions keep coming out. so he tried today to belittle kamala, gripe about the fact that his campaign was all set to run against joe and that didn't happen, try to say kamala has turned black "" and she used to be ""indian"" in an attempt to smear and diminish (in his mind) her appeal to black voters, and put down jd as well by saying whoever is vice president doesn't matter. but he failed in all ways! the question was about if jd vance was ready to be president on day one, especially because of trump's age. harris faulkner from fox news tried to softball perfectly guide him into the right answer, by reminding him that she'd spoken to him on the day of the assassination attempt and he said ""anything can happen..."" to her supposedly more than once during that interview. if trump was smart he would have picked up on her clues, and answered about the seriousness of the assassination attempt, how close he came to being taken out, and how it made him reflect even more on the fact that whoever he picked as vp had to be ready to assume presidential duties on day one because who knows what could happen over the next four years? and perfect pivot onto why he picked jd vance and how he has all the confidence in the world in him, the reasons why he's such a great pick and of course he's ready to be president if need be! but of course he didn't do that because he doesn't want to think he himself won't be president for his full term. and also conveniently forgetting that his choice of vp mike pence in his first term turned out ultimately to be the most pivotal in his campaign in 2020, when he turned out to actually be an honest guy who stayed true to his constitutional duties as vp and certified the 2020 election results. despite everything the maga crowd and donald trump himself did, from the fake electors schemes to ""find me votes "" call, to calls against the legitimacy of the voting machines and those counting the votes, to ultimately the riot to overthrow the government, mike pence stood up and did the right thing. even despite calls against his own life and the lives of his family. jd vance has already said he wouldn't do what mike pence did. that's the real reason he picked him. donald trump just turned off enough of those few ""undecided voters "" who are going to decide this election that it might be the worst thing he ever did. kamala can be black and indian, and she is . donald can be white and orange, and he is, kamala can be smart and she is . donald can be smart and he isn't. that's the true story out of this",1

2,"and let's face it, too many people are actually excited for a possible harris win. before she announced, it was a ""maybe joe would die and she'd be president by default"" but it was still voting for the old man. now we get to make history and *choose* to vote for her. and the fact that orange julius is the opponent makes it easier.",0
26,"here is how this will play out harris will just ok. she will sound competent and prepared fox really won't be able to push back much because she'll be prepared for their gotcha questions. that will lead trump to lose his shit and claim they didn't fact check her in real time or she will have one miss step or make one mistake, and that is all anyone will focus on. kind of like how walz had issues loading his shotgun and that is all anyone on fox will talk about. now he's a bumbling idiot is the narrative when he likely was just unfamiliar with the specific firearm",0

4,"because texas and florida are still distant maybes. where trump is up 6.5 points and 4 points respectively in polling averages. *without* a consistent trend of the pin moving at all. the lines on the charts for those states are basically flat. where as pennsylvania is *very close*, with harris up .5 points. and until the most recent polling cycle, a clear trend in her favor. with texas and florida. the press just gets to point at the occasional outlier poll every few weeks and say ""bad news for trump"". in pennsylvania they can track every minute change and shout about what it all means. in either case, neither texas or florida are much expected to be a decisive state this year. it's just that if they did flip dnc. it would be wild, and hand trump a loss. if even one did, it'd be next to impossible. trump would have to almost sweep every other tight state. the actual set of states that people are looking at are north carolina, georgia, wisconsin, michigan, arizona, nevada and pennsylvania. harris is currently ahead or gaining everywhere but arizona iirc. and pennsylvania has the largest number of electoral votes out of all of them. pennsylvania plus pretty much any 2 other battle ground states, takes the election. unless those 2 other state are arizona and nevada. and just demographically and on political breakdown. pa has some cross over and implications in terms of both the midwestern states and those southern states. if the democrats take pa, the gop kinda has to sweep almost every other battleground. and there's probably bad news for their chances on that if the democrats take pa. things are not nearly that narrow for the dnc if pa squeaks over into red. recent electoral history here doesn't exactly point to fertile ground for them either. pa hadn't voted for a gop nominee since ghw bush in 1988. and trump did narrowly win in 2016 he only mustered 48% of the vote to do it. he actually *gained* votes (barely) here in 2020 but still lost. he's currently polling a point behind what he got in 2020, and his anointed candidates haven't done well in the state since 2016.",0

11,"i don't think it's the woman part that gets them (outside utah, anyway) it's the bit where they still think all their neighbors support the gop no matter what. i'm convinced there will be a lot of quiet votes for harris in those areas, because trump isn't making himself look bad so much as making *them* look bad.",0

3107,"the last few days could not have been any more of a nightmare for trump world, given how unexpectedly well-executed this pivot has been for the democrats. i don't think anyone predicted it could go this well: * dems have immediately unified behind harris and practically ended their infighting. any cracks in the first 48 hours could have been fatal, but it's clear that the party is rock solid behind this. * harris is much improved as a speaker compared to even a few years ago, and is ready to meet the moment, and serve as a perfect foil for the opponent she is facing. her initial speeches have been well received, and she's already hit on a slogan that's resonating with voters (""we're not going back""). * the democrat base has done a complete 180, and is now super energised and raring to go. trump is relying on demoralised dem voters and depressed turnout to win. this is the single biggest threat to trump, more so than any individual candidate, and could well prove fatal for him if dems can keep this momentum going to election day. * harris has managed to raise a huge amount of money in just a couple of days. the trump campaign had *just* caught up with biden in campaign funds, and are now lagging behind again. * trump is going to have to waste a good chunk of that money redoing his entire campaign, because it was fully geared around shitting on biden specifically, rather than promoting any positive message about trump (because there simply isn't one). * the gop apparently did not prepare for this scenario at all, despite egging it on for a long time, and are struggling to align on a narrative against harris. * any possible bounce from the shooting and rnc has been wiped out by coverage of biden>harris. that trump didn't really get a bounce from the shooting suggests he has hit probably his hard ceiling, meanwhile harris is starting from a roughly even position with him with plenty of room to grow. * trump's arrogance led him to think he had the election in the bag, and has now lumbered himself with a strategically poor and unpopular vp pick. there's still a monumental task ahead, and it's absolutely not going to be a sure thing, but i don't think the past couple of days could have gone any better for kamala harris. as a politics geek, it's just been amazing to watch what should be a difficult transition unfold so smoothly.",0

23,"i’m a lifelong arizonan, born and raised in mesa, and if you told me in the year 2000 that one day the mormon mayor of mesa was coming out to endorse a democratic nominee for president i would’ve thought you were crazy. growing up in east mesa it was like living in provo or boise or some other city in the “morridor” (as in mormon corridor, or a belt of states west of the mississippi that have a lot of lds adherents; conversely, i’ve heard the area referred to as “mordor” as well…), needless to say it was stiflingly conservative, conformist and regressive in its views and outlook. obviously the city has changed by leaps and bounds in terms of demographics - the mormon community centered around the temple downtown, mountain view high school and the lehi neighborhood that used to make up a large percentage of the population of mesa has largely moved further south and east to gilbert, queen creek and chandler - but it’s still striking that a mesa mayor, someone who is almost always a conservative white gop man, to endorse a dem candidate like harris. it makes sense as az is a really rather strange state in terms of its politics, especially over the last decade. besides the influx of west coasters moving to the valley for jobs and cheap(er) housing making the state purple, there is a large enough contingent of both independents and never-trumper republicans here that what ostensibly should be a cakewalk for someone like trump becomes an actual battleground state.",1

61,"behind paywall 1/2 the process of removing biden as the democratic presidential candidate can’t exactly be said to have worked well, but it worked. and now it’s time for americans to turn the same self-regulatory instincts to biden’s 78-year-old former rival. trump’s campaign is already falling apart– most recently with the shameful attempt to use a ceremony at arlington cemetery as an electioneering platform. but there are deeper reasons to inspect trump’s political credibility now. because cognitively speaking, trump is beginning to make biden look like oscar wilde. events move so fast, the news cycle is so accelerated, that the most telling signs of trump’s decline pass without commentary. it might be illuminating to dwell a little on one of them. about two weeks ago, trump seemed to denigrate the medal of honor, america’s highest award for military valour in combat. speaking at his new jersey golf club, he was praising miriam adelson, the israeli-american widow of the late republican mega-donor sheldon adelson, when he recalled how he once gave her the presidential medal of freedom. “miriam, i watched sheldon sitting so proud in the white house when we gave miriam the presidential medal of freedom. that’s the highest award you can get as a civilian, it’s the equivalent of the congressional medal of honor, but civilian version. it’s actually much better, because everyone gets the congressional medal of honor that’s soldiers. they’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead. she gets it and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. and they’re rated equal.” the liberal press, now comfortably primed to respond with moral outrage to every outrageous thing trump says, pounced. here he was, once again, spewing contempt for the military. however, few, if any, people pointed out that it is not the “congressional medal of honor” but the “medal of honor”. had biden made that mistake, an outcry would have ensued. and trump’s patterns of thinking here indicate a cognitive decline in the way he apprehends and makes sense of reality that goes beyond mere propriety or morality. it is, of course, wholly deficient in empathy to justify the lesser value of the medal of honor by citing the fact that the soldiers who receive it have “been hit so many times by bullets, or they’re dead”. but it is not simply, as people have suggested, that trump, who despises “losers”, considers a “loser” anyone who has been wounded in battle, or taken prisoner in combat. it is that, first, he does not seem to recognise the moral significance of bodies and minds in pain. and, second, he is not aware of the importance, social and moral, of pretending he does recognise another’s pain even if he doesn’t. then there is the language itself. it suddenly swerves into the incoherent. trump says that “everyone gets the congressional medal of honor that’s soldiers”. (he could also mean: “everyone gets the congressional medal of honor – that’s soldiers.”) the words verge on nonsense. either he is saying that every soldier gets the medal of honor, which is absurdly untrue. or he is saying that only soldiers get the medal of honor, but that every soldier gets it, which is similarly absurd, but with a twist. if biden had spoken in such a way a year ago, he would have been pushed aside all the sooner. trump’s extreme rhetoric is still routinely dismissed as him “just being trump” – the usual hyperbole and bluster. yet it is hardly mere bluster or hyperbole for trump to claim, as he has recently, that “you can’t walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. you get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be.” perhaps the most alarming part of that sentence is the disturbingly disconnected “whatever it may be”. and it is not merely vulgar for trump to republish a post claiming that kamala harris has achieved political success thanks to dispensing oral sex. the claim is not just appalling; it is crazy to make it in public. that post appeared with several others: a photo of harris in an orange prison jumpsuit, a photo of obama with a caption asking trump supporters if they wanted obama to be tried before a military tribunal, and photos of trump with ai-created lions. sane people do not lack inhibition to this degree. but trump’s repetition of such lunacy has made it routine. call it the banality of madness. trump’s assertion, made in deadly earnest in an interview last tuesday with dr phil mcgraw, that god had spared him from being assassinated in order to save america, and possibly the world, barely raised an eyebrow. incredibly, in america, where just about everything goes – trump, for example – there is a tacit prohibition against discussing trump’s obvious mental incapacity in public. the taboo was imposed in february 2017, just over one year after trump’s inauguration. that was when the new york times published a short letter, signed by “33 psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers”. noting trump’s “inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions”, and his pattern of distorting reality to suit his own “psychological state”, the letter reasoned that “[i]n a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed”. the signatories concluded that trump’s “speech and actions make him incapable of serving safely as president”. trump’s continuing refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election makes the letter prescient.",1
11,"a lot of “charisma” isn’t anything internal and depends on context. she’s a major party presidential nominee now and current vice president and not just a failed primary candidate. she could be acting exactly the same and people would see her as having more charisma. even as bad as joe biden was seen by people before he dropped, they were still grading him on a curve, because he was already president and people were complementing him on just barely holding his shit together reading from a teleprompter. because he is the president and has power still.",0

3,"this is how freedom of the press dies. when billionaire newspaper owners kill articles that might upset political leaders because they're afraid those leaders will retaliate in other sectors in which they do business then you have a huge problem. anyone who is still claiming that american institutions are holding firm and resisting corruption and destruction needs to wake up and realize what they've already lost. before trump, the idea of a us president targeting someone's companies because that person owns a newspaper that wrote one or more unflattering articles about said president would have been unthinkable. never mind trump constantly bitching about not being able to run the country like hitler ran ww2 germany. any non-maga voter who is voting for trump or hasn't made up their mind yet deserves a kick in the ass because they're obviously dumbasses. the difference between centrist democrats and republicans is very little, so even if you lean republican but love your country then the choice should be crystal clear and you should be rebuking donald trump and his cronies and casting your vote for kamala. hopefully someone can start calling out these dumbass undecideds and get them to shut the hell up because at this stage no one should be listening to what they have to say.",0

(they mention biden because the discussion was before he dropped out). there is the mention of one dude on their website, peter sarasohn. he used to work for bernie's campaign and also worked for several other dem campaigns. i looked up the candidates listed on their website--those are the ones they're endorsing. and indeed, even though some are not in battleground states, most or all are in districts the rnc has targeted to flip to red. so it appears these are actually legit guys to donate to if you want dems to win, not some nefarious astroturf campaign to lure dems to donate to candidates whose seats are not at risk. so it's possible this is a perfectly legitimate organization that is doing exactly what they have said they plan to do, they're just not doing it as professionally as they could have done. personally i'll stick to donating directly to candidates or via actblue.",1

925,"so here's the scenario we propose: 1. vp pence, presiding over the joint session (or senate pro term grassley, if pence recuses himself), begins to open and count the ballots , starting with alabama (without conceding that procedure, specified by the electoral count act, is required). 2. when he gets to arizona, he announces that he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other states. 3. at the end, he announces that because of the disputes in the 7 states, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those states. that means the total number of ""electors appointed"" - the language of the 12th amendment, is 454. this reading of the 12th amendment has also been advanced by harvard law professor lawrence tribe. a ""majority of the electors appointed"" would therefore be 228. there are at this point 232 votes for trump, 222 votes for biden . pence then gavels president trump as re-elected. 4. howls, of course, from the democrats, who now claim, contrary to tribe's prior position, that 270 is required. so pence says, fine. pursuant to the 12th amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority. that sends the matter to the house, where the ""the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote."" republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. president trump is re -elected there as well. 5. one last piece. assuming the electoral count act process is followed and, upon getting the objections to the arizona slates, the two houses break into their separate chambers, we should not allow the electoral count act constraint on debate to control. that would mean that a prior legislature was determining the rules of the present one-a constitutional no no. so someone -ted cruz, rand paul, etc . - should demand normal rules (which includes the filibuster). that creates a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors, if they had not already done so. 6. the main thing here is that pence should do this without asking for permission - either from a vote of the joint session or from the court. let the other side challenge his actions in court, where again, tribe (and others) claims that these are non -justiciable political questions should be raised to get those actions dismissed. the fact is that the constitution assigns this power to the vice president as the ultimate arbiter. we should take all of our actions with that in mind.",2

21,i heard part of that segment. it was crazy to hear how disconnected from reality some of these people are. one trump voter was worried people are too excited about her. another attacked her credentials asking what has she done as vp. another said she failed at the border crisis and still got a promotion. even the “right leaning swing voters” brought up crap arguments like kamala knew biden was in poor health and didn’t say anything so she’s just being opportunistic. you can tell they all lived in the right wing bubble. the only bright spot was there were signs of cracks in their bubble. i’m always irritated by the media when they don’t seem to push back on any misconceptions or blatant lies these people regurgitate. i guarantee the lady that said kamala hasn’t done anything as vp couldn’t name one thing pence actually did. if asked i’m sure she’d give a vague answer like “he stood up for our values as americans.”,0

[mcconnell denounces fellow republicans for fawning over hungary’s viktor orbán]( [the reason netanyahu and putin both want a trump victory]( the outcomes of the two biggest wars in the world hang in the balance of the american presidential election, even though u.s. troops are not involved in combat in either one. if donald trump wins the election, both wars will get much, much worse. russian president vladimir putin and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu both want trump to win the american presidential election so that they can prolong and intensify their brutal wars without the possibility of american interference. netanyahu has conducted his war in gaza believing that the biden administration can’t rein him in before the presidential election without risking severe damage to the political prospects of democratic presidential candidate kamala harris. netanyahu has purposefully sought to put the democrats in a bind between the conflicting political demands of two components of the party’s base — a progressive constituency appalled by the war and a centrist faction that backs israel. netanyahu has thus forced the biden administration to engage in a difficult balancing act: supporting israel, while still pushing for a ceasefire and the long-term goal of the creation of a palestinian state — a compromise stance that has outraged progressives while also upsetting many conservative jewish voters. [netanyahu son and parler -so netanyahu was directly behind january]( documents filed during legal proceedings in the united states have revealed that prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s son yair netanyahu had commercial ties with an american company called parlement technologies, the former parent company of parler, a controversial social network affiliated with the far-right. parler went offline in the wake of reports that it fueled the storming of the capitol on january 6, 2021. parler was launched in 2018, when donald trump was president, and became popular among extreme right-wing circles in the u.s. the network boasted almost unrestricted freedom of speech, with hardly any moderation of the content shared on it. it became fertile ground for disseminating conspiracy theories like qanon and claims that the 2020 presidential election, in which joe biden defeated trump, was stolen. days after the january 6 attack, apple and google removed parler from their app stores when it turned out that the platform was used to disseminate messages promoting violence and inflaming emotions that led a throng to storm the capitol building during a joint session of congress. on the eve of parler’s collapse, it reportedly had 15 million users, setting new user records in its last days. however, after amazon’s aws cloud hosting services and other suppliers decided to stop serving the network, parler went offline. [so netanyahu was directly behind january]( all this destruction for this - [trump on october 7 anniversary: israel needs to do one thing – ‘get smart about trump’]( u.s. news - haaretz.com trump further politicized the anniversary by attacking the biden administration and the president’s relationship with prime minister benjamin netanyahu, saying, “you always have to listen to a president, and then you have to do whatever you want. now, bibi was held up a little bit because, psychologically, you have a president. he probably would have been further along, but he’s pretty far along. he’s not listening at all, you know that. they don’t even speak.” he also suggested that gaza’s geography represents a potential economic windfall, echoing comments from his son-in-law jared kushner earlier this year. “it could be better than monaco. it has the best location in the middle east, the best water, the best everything. it’s got, it is the best. i’ve said it for years. you know, i’ve been there, and it’s rough. it’s a rough place, before, you know, all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth that’s happened over the last couple of years,” trump said. “i said, wow, look at this. i mean, they have the back of a plant facing the ocean, you know. there was no ocean as far as that was concerned. they never took advantage of it. you know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place – the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,” trump continued. he added, “it could be so beautiful. it could be the best thing in the middle east, but it could be one of the best places in the world. and you know, there were other civilizations. i don’t know if you know this; it’s crazy, but that’s been a rough neighborhood. that’s been a rough place. you know, underneath that are two other civilizations where they were wiped out, and they started over and built on top.” new 🚨[warning]( from robert reich",1

3,"> his statement is a transparent attempt to shift bad press solely to vance (not sure how that helps trump's campaign?) in this case this is just trump being a narcissist, but it's also in some ways a return to one of the political schools of thought on the purpose of the vice president during a campaign, from around 15 or 20 years ago. however the difference is that the ""bad press"" that was being diverted then wasn't being a super cringey weird ass, but instead being more aggressive. the idea was that if the president went on the attack too much it would make them seem too combative/less professional/less of a leader. the presidential debates were a little more friendly, and the vice presidential debate could be more combative and mud slinging. that (and the attack ads) would let the campaigns get their negative messages out, but insulate the president from attacking fellow americans. bush jr. and cheney probably exemplify this, because ""boy i sure would like to have a beer with bush"" was... probably the main thing bush had going for him? so cheney going on the attack while bush stayed personable worked really well for them against gore/lieberman and kerry/edwards. now obviously we are in a very different political place where the republicans completely abandoned this ""pretend to not hate other americans' guts"" strategy ever since 2016. trump doesn't want to use vance to try to pretend he's not a mean asshole bully, because he thinks those are all good traits, but if vance could somehow make people not realize he's a cringey, pathetic weirdo too, that would be great for trump.",1

3,thats because they have no money and are filled with the bottom of the barrel that will toe the line. their entire campaign was against biden. so now they are trying to frankenstein that strategy against kamala and it comes off as janky and low effort. the people left on the trump campaign aren’t strategists or big thinkers. the overhaul they would need to do to even come back to even will never happen as long as the cheeto is in charge. his fragile narcissistic ego could never handle the tough choices to actually win. and even if there was some sort of behind the scenes coup to dump trump there is no one waiting in the wings to continue the charge. it’s kind of amazing seeing such a slow motion train wreck happening in real time.,1

10,"[katie johnson's full testimony of 2/11/16 - youtube]( **economic impact**: trump’s administration added $7.8 trillion to the national debt, more than any other president in a single term. * he bankrupted like every business he was involved in and refused to pay people and only got away with it because he screwed them out of the money they needed to sue him, and the economy, his strategy is to get rid of protections that protect the people and the country and our way of life, our means to earn a living and live off the land and sea when that fails, he will continue screwing people because he can profit from it and get away with it, because people believe wrongfully, incorrectly believe that a short term gain, outweighs the long term consequence that the people the country and the planet will pay for. this list could be way longer. considering the election is very soon, it should be. a big one is, harris may propose an assault weapon ban, but trump proposed to terminate the constitution, and all the rights laws and freedoms enshrined therein. reaffirming that trump is the one who in his own words intends to ""take the guns first, due process later"" not kamala harris. people still believe in qanon, despite trump admitting that qanon is crap, also his own words. and if it is crap, then why else? on a related note, they believe that he is uh, pro abortion, but if you believe his accuser, when she was tied up to a bed at 13, he ignored her request to use a condom, and threw cash in her face telling her to get an abortion. they believe that he is going to, uproot establishment, or deep state, he wants to install his own. he wants to replace the media with his own state media because fox wasn't loyal enough, despite editing his reaction to the epstein question, and not telling him that he was live on air when he said ""we gotta kill families."" people believe that he is pro gun, that he is pro free speech, he already has infringed on both and doesn't hide that he intends to continue doing so if re-elected. its a lot easier to haggle and argue about whether he violated the constitutional rights, by passing red flag laws, then it is to argue that he didn't violate 1st amendment free speech with censorship on truth social, but what can't be disputed or argued is that on that same platform, he claimed to create for free speech, he used it to post a call to terminate the constitution, making him, truly unfit, and untrustworthy, to uphold the oath to defend the document that he is calling to terminate, that all military and government and police are all sworn to defend by force. so, no, he is not the bigger defender or the lesser evil when it comes to any rights or freedoms enshrined in the constitution. no, he will not defend the freedoms they think he will, poisoning the land, people, cutting off those in dire need and leaving alliances won't make us great. about that, they think he is against the communists, the communists put money in his chinese account when he left office his products are made in china and he intends to cut off aid to ukraine while people waving soviet flags invade ukraine, he is not against the communists, he is in love with kim jung un, and thats not just softening relations, he is helping our adversary at our expense, literal expense, we pay more to properly dispose of unused expired rocket then we do to give them to people who need them to defend their homes and people and country. he promised to end the war? by cutting off urgently needed aid, which doesn't really end the war, or prevent it from spreading or leading to another one. it emboldens them and strengthens them instead of stopping them and setting a precedent.he added more to the national debt than bidenthey believe that he will be the end of false flags. he openly proposed false flags when he was president.he is not of god, he admitted he is not christian when he said you won't have to vote anymore if i win.he does not embody any of the values or teachings or obey any of the commandmentshe admitted to sexually assaulting a married woman. he lies constantly. he stole both health, home freedom and life with his actions, that killed americans, here in the homeland.and no, he is not the pro israel ticket either, he said to blame the jews if he loses the election.oh, forgot another one, drain the swamp? he put scott pruitt, a man who sued the epa on behalf of big oil, for protecting the environment, and by extension, not just wildlife but us too, that guy to be in charge of the epa. he put a woman who wants to defund public schools in charge of department of education.\^he did not drain the swamp, he installed and appointed swamp monsters and made it worse than ever before * despite qanon claiming he is secretly fighting pedophiles, he admitted that assertion is crap, he owned a teen beauty pageant and used owner status to look at the girls in the dressing room, his daughter ivanka said yeah he does that like she is used to it, and to top it off, he didn't just fly on the epstein plane and didn't just molest, but forcibly raped young girls, when they cried for him don't do it, and then to stop doing it despite her clear boundary and plea that he either don't penetrate her, stop penetrating her or use a condom, and he told her to ""get an abortion bitch"" so he isn't even really pro life, and if he went from saying the days of infringing on your 2nd amendment is over to saying take the guns first due process later, what makes you think he won't show his true colors on abortion after he wins a 2nd term? * epstein was a protégé of donald barr, the father of trump's attorney general bill barr. jeffrey epstein was hired as a math teacher at the dalton school in new york city by donald barr, who was the headmaster at the time. donald barr is the father of william barr, who served as attorney general under trump",1

182,"i've been seeing people in /conservative say this for the first time as of the 5 or 6 days or so. i was reading comments in a post an hour ago about the walz as vp pick and a few people were expressing exasperation with the fact trump's rallies are 2 hours of boring, low energy rambling and rants, and that compared to kamala who is doing 45 minute appearances with enthusiasm and on-topic focused speeches, he looks like someone who only has one act and it's been played out over and over and over for years. they're tiring of it. now, that doesn't mean that he's losing much support in that sub but as rabid as that sub has been for him the fact that even there, this close to the election, it is nice to see its becoming more acceptable to point out his obvious lackluster and that his name calling isn't working for him anymore.",0
10,"and i would generally agree with that, but still flatly deny that this overlap extends to *all trump supporters support him because of racism.* i don't mean to argue just to argue. fundamentally i think there's no future for our country if, however unlikely, we can't eventually learn to speak across the aisle again. for what my vibe check is worth, i would love to believe that most people are kinda tired of fighting each other with this trump-era level of vitriol. to that end, we do have some responsibility to be open to the conversation when/if the time comes for us to start talking to each other, and that can't really happen if we take myopic views of one another: that all trumpers are just racist, or that all kamala supporters are woke communists, etc... whether it's to fight them, or to eventually come together again to compete with the civility we were meant to, we're better off having a good-faith interpretation of their beliefs. sorry i got all speechy, i think i had too much coffee this morning.",1

[theodor adorno]( anti-semitism and fascist propaganda (1946) from: the stars down to earth and other essays on the irrational in culture it’s not mere mass hypnotism. there is a narcissistic gratification that comes from the fascist ritual of revelation that aims to establish the identification between the leader and the followers. take racism for example. i see this in my mildly racist friends and family members. even some of the ones who won't vote for republicans any more still can't see it. they won't admit that they are racist. i'm not talking kkk here, just people who have never confronted their internalized racism. it's deep down psychological shit. trump has studied fascist leaders and he absolutely nailed it. of course his mind is going now but make no mistake, he was very calculating about this. he might not be an erudite, worldly man, but he was very smart about this manipulation. people who have been living their entire lives conforming to a society that would ostracize them for breaking any norms live vicariously through his inhibitions. he has coopted a frustrated middle class from the rightful left wing ideologies that actually represented them. the democratic party played the role of ""the left"" for years in the absence of an actual far-left in the us thanks to mccarthyism etc. (after far left activists were instrumental in winning labor rights in the late 19th and early 20th centuries). see also: ur fascism - umberto eco the struggle against liberalism in the totalitarian view of the state - negations: essays in critical theory - herbert marcuse **p.s. i am voting for harris and democrats all the way down the ticket.**",0

(not a direct quote.) they're inventing some of the most bizarre conspiracy theories to try to fit ""biden steps down for the good of the nation; harris steps up to top the ticket and quickly earns enough delegates for the nomination"" into ""biden is a grasping, single-minded dictator who wants to destroy the country,"" and it doesn't fit.",1

15,"ok so i'm a dude that's *42* and the **only reality** i've known in regard to whether women are to fully have 100% ownership over their bodies is that **yes, they can and do.** to be clear here, the only reality i have ever known about abortion, at **42 years old**, is that the *supreme court* said **yes** to abortion access being a right. **and they are surprised that women are lining up in droves to vote against them after they proudly and** ***bombastically congratulated themselves for actually ending this fifty year ruling***? ***i*** voted the instant i was able to, and i live in *vermont*, where this state now has the absolute ***best*** abortion-access available at the shielded-state level in the entire nation. we get our ballots mailed out automatically based on registration address and so when i got my ballot about a week and a half ago, it was filled out and dropped on in person the very next day. we ain't fucking around. vermont is going to give harris her largest % margin of victory nationwide *just like we did with biden.* oh yeah, even though i **never** vote republican (i go sanders, becca balint, etc. each time), it **was in fact** our republican governor who actually championed shielding abortion access at the state level **immediately** once roe fell. he even said, specifically, that not doing so would actually be the wrong, immoral thing to do. this same republican governor stayed up night after night after night during covid when trump's admin dragged its ass on stimulus checks and he was signing out treasury checks (that were given the ok) to each and every vermonter who hadn't gotten their much needed emergency funds. this was our republican governor doing this. ***maybe vermont really does line up to being one of the best states in the country for education standards. yaknow, since it's consistently in the top 3.***",2
165,"yep 100%. this was really a race for who would listen to voters. maga is starting to eat vance from the inside. dems were starting to do that to biden with good reason, so they pivoted and enhanced their campaign by leagues. this is how to play the game. its cutthroat and not always pretty, but it gets results. very very happy with the unity and energy behind kamala.",1
12,"> everyone is united towards the common goal of keeping a fascist away from the white house. i think this is key to the speed at which everyone got behind harris. there's not a dnc delegate on the planet who doesn't see the threat that don-old trump poses to the country. they also knew that there was no chance that anyone in the party could stand up a presidential campaign apparatus in the couple weeks before the dem convention. so, combine harris already on a ticket, that ticket already has a national campaign infrastructure, and $90mil in the bank, the choice of candidate becomes obvious. i'm glad it wasn't democratic. dnc delegates are people who have run for office, and / or have worked full time on a campaign. they knew what was possible and what was not. had it gone to a popular vote, that would have been a nightmare. ""never underestimate the stupidity of people in large groups"". i haven't said this since pre-covid, but maybe we got the branch to the good timeline this time?",1

52,this part made no sense to me. she continued to talk and baier repeatedly said they're telling me to wrap it up. it wasn't kamala. it was abundantly clear who wanted to wrap it up. i couldn't believe that they were claiming kamala's team was the one calling the interview when i had just finished watching it happen. such an obvious lie but fox news watchers who didn't watch the interview will believe it. i thought baier was supposed to be one of the decent ones? the main takeaway that i got was that baier is not a serious interviewer,0
38,hahaha rfk jr. was intented to take votes from biden/harris now it's taking from trump. too funny,2

8,kamala is also causing a lot of infighting amongst the republicans. vance is getting targeted as weak pick. trump is going to montana and not focused on other battleground states. ramaswampy is writing 2-3 page monologues on how the trump campaign needs to focus on the issues and not all of these other tactics. some republicans in the media are even admitting that trump is faltering a bit.,2
41,"read the article- the voter who asked a question on economic policy left stating that ""they were voting for what's best for their family..."" implying that trump's economic policy will be better for her family. if you are voting for your checking account, do some fucking research on how the policies will impact the economy- so far most economists favor harris's policies and are concerned by the impact of trumps.",0

71,in the conservative sub they posted a picture saying that 80+% of articles about kamala were positive and 90+% of articles about donny were negative. and in their mind that meant that mainstream media was obviously biased. but like how do you write a positive article about the dumpster fire that is donald trump. how do you put a positive spin on him needing to use a bullet proof box around him because he continues to have rallies outdoors in fields because he fails to pay venues and can't have a rally in an arena. like how do you look at that and go we need more feel-good stories about how he thinks his daughter is a hot piece of ass.,0

11,"70k republicans for harris, 40k christian’s for harris, a fuck tons of haley voters for harris. you really think these folks are gonna fall in line for trump after creating these groups and organizing for harris? they hate trump with a passion and understand democracy is at stake. i’m pretty confident they’ll do the right thing. theres also a huge increase in voter registration and a massive gender gap. women vote more often than men in usual elections and abortion is on all the ballot nationwide with p2025. there was a 175% increase in young black women voters alone. women are fucking pissed and coming for him in roevember. we got this. if i’m ever feeling hopeless or negative i just do another phone bank and talk to voters who are fucking ready to vote and put this dude to rest for good. if you’re this worried then do something!!! you’ll feel better afterwards, i guarantee it!",0
123,"it was never too late. i'm not american and i'll tell you that your campaigns are ridiculously long. just because something has always been one way doesn't mean that it should continue to be that way. you also had a rematch of the same two people from last time. one of them is a narcissistic, wannabe dictator who is trying to escape jail at all costs. the other, while competent, was already old last time and this time, he's visibly slower and needs more help moving around. both of them need to hand us their car keys. what was going to happen when one of them won? we already knew because they've both been president. putting kamala in, is akin to putting obama in. not because their skin color is similar but because they are different from the same ol' boring old people. they're forward thinking and strive for change (for the better). biden had reached his ceiling, he wasn't going to climb any higher. kamala starts at biden's ceiling and can only go up. kamala might potentially hurt trade with canada a bit (trump definitely will) but i don't care because anything beats having to see pumpkin face yell gibberish on tv all the time (and yes canadian tv keeps showing that garbage too)",1
9,"i'm sure biden dropping out was something that was meticulously planned out for at least 2 weeks by biden and his top administrative or campaign staffers, kamala, jill, some high ranking dnc leaders, and anyone who had been short listed in the media as a likely replacement. he wanted to make sure no one on his side who had the power to cause trouble before the convention would be caught off guard. kamala was always going to be the default choice, and if they decided she wasn't fit to run for president, she would have had to immediately make a public announcement that she wouldn't run. there's no way biden or anyone else would have allowed this to become a contested convention. that would have been a disaster far worse than biden simply continuing his campaign.",0
2,"he backed out of 60min cause he didnt want to be facted checked... and if you dont believe me, watch the 60min intro for kamala's 60min interview. trumps rotten to the core.",1
3,"all the neocons, warmongers, military industrial complex are supporting harris. harris is the hope to a lot of people.",2
231,yeah he seemed like he was trying to stay dignified which is nice and all but i’m glad kamala is going for the jugular.,2
3,"i’m in pa, philly suburb that’s fairly purple, and i drive around a lot for work . there are less trump signs. people that kept their 2020 signs up for years don’t have them. that being said, there’s still a lot of signs, but not as many as 2020. also, if someone has one trump sign, they probably have 6-10 trump signs. and one of them is enormous. most anti-biden signs are gone, and there aren’t too many signs attacking harris. i can think of one house that had many signs including a “joe and the ho”, and currently there are zero signs. very few policy signs alongside, maybe a pro life sign as well. many harris houses have multiple signs. some denouncing project 2025, or specifically about women’s rights. also a few signs specifically denouncing trump. both signs are equally likely to have down ballot candidate signs as well. and sometimes just a lone sign, where i don’t even know the candidate, but eventually see the sign in a yard with 12 other signs. the nature of my work has me driving to new destinations every 1-2 weeks, so i have a pretty good idea of trends of signs on fairly busy roads. i wish there was another word for sign because now it’s starting to look like not a real word anymore.",0
9,as a harris supporter i would be just as appalled if the situation was reversed and a harris supporter sucker punched an elderly trump supporter. terrible. i've known people who have died from just 1 sucker punch. healthy young people. i may not like a lot of trump supporters but i would never wish violence on them.,0
36,wait until kamala rolls out policies for womens rights and abortion. i told you it'll be all over because of that.,0
8,"this was especially annoying because if the candidate swap was going to happen, there was a ton of work to be done behind the scenes and up until the moment biden withdrew it was absolutely essential to maintain that he was in the race to win it (in the unlikely event that the swap fell through). the fact that nothing significant leaked during that period is astounding and quite the opposite of ""disarray"". the fact that harris was the de facto nominee just hours after biden dropped out proves that his coordination took place.",2
27,harris doesn't need to speak though. her best move here is let trump sink himself.,0
847,"a harris win will give harris leverage over netanyahu, a trump win will give netanyahu leverage over trump.",0

16,harris is playing offense now.,2

40,"yeah i was a big hillary supporter, voted for her in 08, but did not like her campaign strategy at all 2016, focusing on trump's character instead of his policies doesn't work when you have bill clinton next to you. kamala doesn't have that kind of baggage, knock on wood, this time around.",1
3,"color me orange, call me coward. how ironic that maga criticizes kamala for not doing enough interviews when their crybaby candidate does not want to engage in any activity outside of the bubble.",2
52,"to be fair the four years ago question is poison to harris’ message. it presumes she is the incumbent and responsible for current circumstances. she’s trying to run as the hope and change candidate, so the last thing she wants to do is compare today with the trump’s administration.",1
146,i went on tiktok to check out a couple videos and it's like a whole different world. i learned about brat and falling off a coconut tree. i have never heard the term the divine 9 so i was reading up on them. i saw several videos of black women giving advice to white women on how to convince their friends to vote for harris. it feels completely differently than it did a week ago.,0
6,"yup, exactly this. i don't expect kamala to go do it or even waste her time with it at all. but someone from her campaign can for sure make a phone call.",2
14,"this take is an extremely understandable one. simultaneously, i would like to offer an alternative statement: ""i am a republican. i have served my entire time in public life as a republican. i believe republican ideals are the right ideals for this country. i believe republican values are the better values. despite his insistence to the contrary, however, donald trump betrays those ideals, he betrays those values, and may have -- or, at least, almost certainly will -- betray our beloved nation. having served as his vice president for four years and his running mate for several months before that, i saw him up close and personal and i know without a doubt he is unequivocally wrong for this nation in any capacity. it is for this reason i feel i have no choice but to announce my support for vice president kamala harris as the next president of these united states.""",1
92,we know he's obsessed with crowd sizes from the inauguration. it'll blow his narcissist bubble if kamala draws massive crowds that are much bigger than his. if you wanna drive him mad all you gotta do is attend a rally lol.,1

57,"brightsides: —it’s been *less than 2wks* since her campaign was launched, and look how not only the party has coalesced behind her, but her candidacy has invigorated dems generally —she’s raised hundreds of millions in campaign funds in two weeks, adding to the biden-harris fund that was already at $100m —her campaign has already proven itself prompt, capable, and tactfully savage. now that the nomination has been secured, they can go gloves-off.",1
13644,"when trump was shot(?) and the photos of him looking relatively badass were circulating i was really worried that he was going to capitalize on that moment and get a huge boost, especially since it happened right before the convention. the fact that trump managed to completely squander what he was given and that biden was able to take back the narrative by passing the torch to harris and now trump is basically scrambling in the defensive just fills my heart with so much joy.",1
126,yeah i feel like kamala should just run ads that say “i want to fund fema vote for me!” it should be a slam dunk.,0
88,i am in serious disbelief that harris and trump are practically tied. how can people seriously be this stupid,2
58,"2016 shook a lot of people out of their complacency. we know he can win because he's done it before. honestly, i'm seeing parallels between trump 2024 and clinton 2016. in both cases, one of the parties is confident their opponent is destined to fail based on reasons that are not apparent to them, and don't treat the threat as credible enough to pull out all the stops. kamala's acceptance of the nomination at the convention will have the same effect as trump descending that gold escalator, and it will lead to similar results.",1
22,they found it offensive and “not presidential”. they were grasping at straws like they’re doing now with kamala. they called him arrogant for saying he likes dijon mustard as his condiment of choice. it was fucking ridiculous.,1
4,judging by all the billionaires whining about lina khan on tv all the time and pushing harris to get rid of her? at least a little bit. when was the last time you knew who the ftc chair was? search her name on google news and the picture becomes pretty clear.,2
14,"""it's definitely gonna come out on camera. walz and harris are hitting him in the ego."" that's it. he won't be able to hold back much longer as they keep up those hits. he'll explode sooner or later. it would be great if it happens on stage during a debate. (i don't think a debate will ever happen. he'll never agree to anything but a fox invited audience and fox moderators.)",2
23,beyonce will perform thursday night ahead of harris’ formal acceptance.,2
6,"speaking from the uk, i can tell you most of the free world is terrified of a trump re-election. climate, world peace and global health are at risk. the fact that it's even a close race is astounding. most of us breathed a sigh of relief when biden stepped down and harris stepped up, and seeing the energy behind her and these numbers so early is fantastic (and beyoncé's 'freedom' was a fantastic choice in song for the campaign vid!). recently the uk voted out the conservative party after 14 years of mismanagement and corruption, including a botched handling of both brexit and the covid pandemic. even though our labour party have many faults and aren't as progressive as we'd want, we just wanted rid of the tories - and rid of them we got. please get out and vote democrat, american voters....everything rests on your shoulders!",0
7,"this is my take too. as much as i hate ""tiktok trends"" at least this one does more good than harm if it means more votes for harris.",1
7,"no, they can’t because, just like with the media in this country, harris has to perform an act flawlessly and hit every mark with perfection and trump can go into a fugue state on stage nightly and suffer no consequences.",0
8,"trump is a coward and has demonstrated that. they embraced images of him being angry after being shot because it was his only appearance of actual strength, but it's just a visceral reaction anyone has to being shot and surging with adrenaline....you get mad. he's scared to debate kamala. scared to ever admit to any mistake. scared to face a world without terrible greasy brown orange face paint on. scared to have rain on his nasty hair...so much so that he neglected his elected duty during a 100th anniversary of wwi commemoration in france, despite other world leaders attending. his excuse was that a motorcade disrupting people would be bad and a helicopter couldn't fly. wear a hat, use an umbrella, get in a car. not honoring american heroes in wwi due to rain is ridiculous and shameful. he's scared to admit the attempts on his life were by his own followers, not democrats. he's scared to wear normal shoes, instead looking like he's going to fall forward all the time so he appears just a little taller.",0
3640,"no doubt he's been on the phone with the orange dotard and he's told him ""don't worry, when i win, you'll be pardoned for anything that happens in the run up to inaugration"" all these shitheads need to be taken to fucking cleaners if harris wins.",1
3292,and how loudly would desantis whine if harris didn't try to call? he's just a spite-filled hateful sack of shit.,2

19,"democrats are more angry at people who don’t support genocide than they are at the harris campaign who are so unwilling to budge on genocide that they are okay with losing votes and handing the country to trump. they would rather trump win than take a stand against a genocide. their entire campaign strategy lately is moving right and trying to get republicans to vote for them. they are alienating a lot of americans and running such a shitty campaign that they might actually lose to fucking trump, again",0

9,"i do not think trump realizes this but, in the current situation of the race, if trump wwants to win he has to take every opportunity he gets. this even includes debates. he did bad in the recent debate with harris, and only another debate with harris would be where he has a chance to attempt to rectify the mistakes. unfortunately in trump's current situation, not ttaking the debate opportunity could infact hurt his chances of winning.",0
48,"there is zero chance harris says the following statement and is still allowed to remain on the campaign trail: | “i don’t know,” mr. trump said. “i haven’t really been following it too much. i just wish her well, frankly.” “i’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since i lived in palm beach, and i guess they lived in palm beach,” the president continued, referring to the florida town where his mar-a-lago resort is and where mr. epstein had a home. “but i wish her well, whatever it is.” | the current republican nominee for president is on record saying about a known international human trafficker ""i wish her well, whatever it is"" and republicans all pretend as though it is normal. hypocrites.",1
180,i was reading nyt and it was closer but it was because they were doing their weird grading on a curve. they called kamala's assertion that they created over 800000 manufacturing jobs misleading because the estimate apparently got corrected from over 800000 to 740000. that pissed me off so much. they also said trump's transgender illegal immigrant comment just needs context.,0

5,"if harris wins texas, she's going to have a regan style blowout. it's very very unlikely. texas is something like r+12, if harris get's texas you're looking at an electoral map of something like 380 to 158 and a popular vote of ~60% which in us politics would be a blow out. obama was dem +7, you're talking about dem +12 to 13% edit: it'd look like this ->",2

[umberto eco, *ur-fascism*.]( trumpism (which is just a crass, in your face, openly violent and misogynistic, racist , homophobic version of post-nixonian republicanism) is so appealing to men and trump has such a lead among young men compared to young women, and men generally, because they’re appealing to the sense of frustration (mostly but not exclusively white) men experience in a world where they are no longer centered *as much*, and they don’t want to see the world of dismantling patriarchy completed. they’ve also fooled a lot of white women into to thinking they’ll have a better, safer life as glorified fuckmaids than as independent individuals or appealed to their most basic fears via hatemongering claims that they are after your kids. > [fascism] is based upon a selective populism, a qualitative populism, one might say. in a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view — one follows the decisions of the majority. for ur-fascism, however, individuals as individuals have no rights, and the people is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the common will. since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the leader pretends to be their interpreter. having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the people. thus the people is only a theatrical fiction. to have a good instance of qualitative populism we no longer need the piazza venezia in rome or the nuremberg stadium. there is in our future a tv or internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the voice of the people. (ibid) being the voice of the people is a big component of this, too. sayings like “he tells it like it is” aren’t just common hyperbole, they’re the foundation of a powerful form of propaganda. that’s why the republicans place so much emphasis on their perverse version of free speech where one can be permitted to claim that queer people are lusting to molest and convert children but one cannot read a book by a queer person about their experiences; the only permissible language is dehumanizing. > the belief that one’s group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies, both internal and external; > dread of the group’s decline under the corrosive effects of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences; > the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group’s historical destiny; the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason; (robert paxton) it’s essential that the in-group be the normal ones. you can’t be the victim in this scenario if you’re the abnormal, the outsider. there has to be a narrative where everyone is like you and they are the ones who are changing things and questioning the correct and proper path set by the righteous leader. but that doesn’t work if you’re weird and the leader is a fucking weirdo. none of this shit works if you’re weird. so much of it is rooted in conformity and a sense of righteous power and authority and if you just tell them “shut up, you fucking weirdo” it robs them a lot of their power. for it to work, *people have to believe*. i really think that being called weird was the beginning of the end for the modern conservative movement. they have all this elaborate bullshit and fake universities and bizarre newspeak concepts like “ordered liberty” and “freedom actually means living on accordance with blah blah” and it all falls apart if you don’t play along. their entire propaganda program relies on gaslighting people and if enough people just flat out refuse to countenance it, it can’t take root. evil cannot abide mockery, and once you have made god bleed, people will cease to believe in him. when they debate, kamala is going to make trump look confused, weak, small, like a desperate little boy trying to look tough. people will look at him and all they’ll be able to see is that picture of him looking utterly absurd with his arms crossed behind the resolute desk, his forearms at chin level because of his gut and moobs and that silly wannabe mussolini look on his face. that’s why they make such a big deal about her laugh. margaret atwood’s observation goes both ways; a woman is afraid that a man will kill her. trump fears a woman’s laughter.",0

78,yes i think kamala was sticking to a very well thought out strategy of exactly what points to drive home and how to respond to a diatribe of misinformation. she couldn’t possibly address everything he said without coming across as kind of overwhelmed so the better strategy was to stick with key points she wanted to drive home rather than pick apart each thing he said. meant she had to miss some easy wins but that she came across as composed.,2

[the one from iowa being the most telling.]( i’ve made a bunch of comments with other very positive signs and won’t get into them all again right now. but here’s my bottom line prediction: harris is going to win nc. georgia and florida are going to be wild cards but i believe will break blue. the rest will be history. it won’t be close.",0

11,"i don’t even think he does. he’s supposed to go back to where he was shot to have another rally. i’m like what?! he also wants to continue to do open air venues. i know it’s all to show his base he is “tough and not afraid” but he is a fool. i don’t think he would understand it would be for his safety and hers, he will spin it that vp harris is scared. shoot i would be too if a former president was shot and now i have to be around him.",1
2,"done-old will call in; go on a five minute rambling rant about it being election interference; fox will have to hang up on him; then he will declare he was the winner of the debate. in the meantime, kamala will answer their questions, get in a few laughs, and the hosts will look bewildered at the end.",2

8,"i've watched the whole campaign this year and what happened on january 6th, 2021. i can tell you that america is heading towards a very dangerous direction. do not let history repeat itself. we've all learned history in schools, and today, we have very good resources to learn more about it in various forms, whether through books and articles or professors complimentarily giving you information on podcasts and well made documentaries. america is going more mad, more extreme, and it is going more barbaric. most of the renowned trump supporters are a: super rich like elon musk, who can easily fascinate and suck up to trump, and the government can't really affect their well-being, b: pro-israelis, who fail to recognize war crimes, decades of military occupation, decades of inhume blockade in gaza, expansion of the west bank settlememts, and the brutality of their so called defense forses commited by israeli government and its far right leader benjamin netanyahu, c: a far-right extremist and a radical conservative with similar ideologies to those of trump, politicians who are bored with democrats, find trump funny and powerful but tend to neglect all the downsides of trump, the risk of his policies, or how he performed during his presidency. d: ordinary people who are under educated, who lack some information and knowledge, who lack some decent values that make us human and make us united, and who are misled by false media. i'm not saying there's zero flaw in democratic party. first of all, a lack of campaign strategies and harris not being able to answer questions in articulate fashion in some interviews even though her careers and experiences in the field are qualified enough to be a president of the united states. democrats are also getting more and more angry and sometimes stoop to low levels. yes, we're close to the world war 3. but, donald trump had no idea how to even get through covid crisis. imagine how he'd act if the war really spreads across the world.",1

3,i would love to see george w. bush make a statement. i'm sure privately he's disgusted by trump. over the years he's also formed a close friendship with clinton and also seems to have a good rapport with obama. jimmy carter's grandson also recently said that cartee hopes to live long enough to cast his vote for harris.,0
3,she can answer it by talking about how the biden-harris admin had to fix everything that trump did. how they brought down inflation back to 2% which trump exploded. how many jobs they’ve added since 2020. how they just got dockworkers a 50% raise. how they removed the covid restrictions trump enacted. how they passed the chips acts which will create jobs all over america. then she needs to explain that she did all that without congress and in the next four years if given congress they will bring down the prices of food by going after the greedy corporations. by putting back in the regulations that trump gutted to protect consumers. to promote and offer more affordable choices by using government to make sure there is actual competition in the marketplace. democrats really need to start saying “we want to give working class americans the financial freedom they need to focus on enjoying life and not just stressing about basic needs.” i hate that the public option is no longer being talked about. it’s tax credits and immigration. it’s overton window pulling us to dystopian future.,1

42,"i kinda wish they would pull bush jr to give a speech. that’d really drive the final nail in. 4 past presidents, one not even from their party to endorse harris/walz? my god, the internet would break.",2
2,exactly. this means nothing. cruz is still going to win. trump is up 5-6 points on harris and cruz is up 5-6 points on allred. it's not going to be close.,2
3,baier was a joke. he obviously had an agenda and attacked harris at the start of the interview. overall she handled it well but missed the opportunity to tell everyone that the stimulus checks were _not_ from trump and he actually delayed them so that his signature could be put on them. they were issued by congress to help stimulate the economy because so many people lost their jobs thanks to trump’s poor handling of the epidemic.,2

25,"i’m live in western carolina where we were hit hard from the hurricane. gov cooper, biden and harris are all offered ways to help, while trump offered his “condolences” and is on social media ranting about shit that does not help us. i hope people remember that come november.",2

16,"that's because it's a specific narrative being pushed by foreign and domestic powers that want another trump presidency. an election comes around, and even george clooney is suddenly on stage talking about how biden's too old to lead, he's unfit, he should step aside, etc. it's not a mistake that the public narrative suddenly aligns with republican propaganda. it was never about biden's competency, it's about undermining the democratic candidate. i think the only mistake is that they really weren't expecting biden to *actually* give up the chance at a second term. if harris v. trump is this close, imagine what a shit show it would be if the dems were still running biden. persistent, pervasive propaganda. if you tell people the sky is green for so long, eventually you'll exhaust the people who know the truth, and more and more people will start repeating your words as fact.",0

4,"honest question from a non american looking at all this shit happening how are you guys ever going to return to normal? even if harris wins the presidency, revamped the supreme court, and put trump in jail, the political landscape of this country has changed so drastically the next decade will definitely be mark by a surge of conservative violence against the people just because trump has radicalised them to the point where their extremism is on par with terrorists. so many cases of violence and shooting commited by the right against the left and trump isn't even a step in a cell yet. i sincerely hope americans elects a sane president that won't fuck the country over, but honestly what will you do when less than half of the population decides to not accept the outcome and arm themselves?",0
13,"i think harris getting elected is going to turbocharge democrats to start blasting long overdue items on our country’s todo list. they will have to hit the ground running to avoid republican interference. crossing my fingers for a real wham, bam, thank you madam president type of scenario. harris is extremely smart and apparently hires and listens to fellow smart people, and that gives me confidence that she’s going to get shit done. she’s going to be the first woman president, but she’s already been a woman of color her whole life, so she’s absolutely got the best handle on adversity over any other candidate ever. even obama. she is acutely aware of the stakes and how she’s being judged. i know the trope “black girl magic” has become somewhat controversial, but damn she’s amazing! she makes it very hard to deny that there’s something special going on there. like, the woman is radiant. (it doesn’t help that she actually fucking sparkles on camera.) she is beautiful, but more importantly she just radiates this intense intelligence and commanding energy. i really feel like she is up to the task.",1
302,"not to mention arrogant. i watched the panel mentioned in the op. it closes with all the maga women scoffing at the idea that it is even possible for harris to win without cheating, and this one woman offers the clincher line, with a look of pure disdain, and the most dismissive, smug laugh i’ve ever heard, that “no one respects her”. and you can tell she sincerely believes that. the idea that anybody could or would respect kamala harris, the vp of the united states, is just impossible in her mind. these women are beyond hope.",1

81,"no, fuck that. i was in high school, contemplated enlistment during the iraq surge, and still thought bush was a trash human. iirc, he was polling at like 27% favorability on the way out. the least the fucker can do, is tell other republicans to vote harris at this point. the fact that he's choosing to ""not speak ill of other presidents"" is bullshit.",0
3,"oh agreed! i love the way he is able to shoot down conservatives and make them feel dumb(atleast that’s what i get from it) but also that is the same reason why i think kelly would make a better vp for unity. i don’t think he will use such polarizing language. i believe that as a country we need to stop being so antagonistic. mind you the right is soo much more guilty of this, but they are so unwilling to abandon their extremism. i don’t think antagonizing is the right way forward for america. i believe it is why, among other reasons, walz and the kamala campaign have coined “weird” as their attack of choice.",1

9,i was out and about last friday doing some yard sales and i live in a heavily republican area in central pa. people were talking about it and said trump will just walk right into the white house and that a black female would never be president. i chuckled when i heard it then remembered how obama won and hillary won the popular vote but never did i expect this much. i just really hope people stay motivated and excited for harris. i know some people can get bored. adding to the coordination. i think biden knew he was going to drop out. i just think covid was a blessing to get the media off his back and let him process everything. he purposely waited for the rnc to mess with him mostly and bash him then dropped out on a sunday to cause panic with less media coverage. he is a very intelligent man who has been doing this for 50 years. he’s mastered the art of politicking,1

8,"i've heard her described as the ""joyful warrior"". someone who's optimistic and cheerful in the face of adversity and when under attack. laughter to fascists is much like when water was dumped on the wicked witch of the west. fascists will spout absurd, over-the-top arguments. what gives them power is when the opposition comes back with logical arguments to dispute them. their absurd statements gain weight if the other side uses facts to dispute them. person a says that person b is a poopy-face. person b explains, with logic and facts, that they do not have poop on their face and the reasons why. person a throws back that the poopy face was due to person b not knowing how to wipe their butts after going to the bathroom. person b explains that they, of course, know how to wipe their butts. person a, says ""prove it."" or person b cheerfully chuckles and doesn't give the taunt another thought. right after kamala became the democrat presidential candidate, trump started talking about kamala's race - saying that being black was an advantage. that she wasn't black before. he didn't know she was black, why was she hiding it? and kamala laughed. it was the spontaneous chuckle of an upbeat, cheerful parent who's 4 year old just called them a poopy-face. i half expected her to pat him on the head and say it was time for nappies.",0

55,"yup. a lot of the vote is suppressed, and is worse in local elections. ive lived in texas for six years (moved here because of work). every election my polling place has changed. the only listing from the .gov website i can find each time is one looooooooong text document and you have to run a browser “find” just to look it up. no search feature as far as i can tell. the sample ballots are typically wrong cause i live in an unincorporated part of austin. it’s difficult to find each candidates information and policies. they dont allow the use of your cell phone when voting, so you need to write things down on paper before going. mail in voting is shit. they use confusing naming or language to obviscate what each ballot initiative is. there was a initiative to raise teachers pay and in the entire text of the initiative it said nothing about that. lastly in the last local election i made a selection and then went to review my choices on the print out (something a lot of people do not do) and one of my choices was flipped. made a stink about that and recast my vote, but that really made things questionable. most of the recent social insanity by state “leaders” is aimed squarely at stopping more people from moving here and make the state as unappealing possible to democrats. the repubs here can see the direction things are heading as more industries move here. so they are doing everything to convince people their vote doesnt matter or as difficult as possible to vote in general. elon says he is moving space x here, where does he think most of those engineers are coming from… and do you think they will vote r? no. just look at their plans to turn each county into an electoral college style. under that plan, loving county, with i shit you not, a population of 94! would have the same voting power as harris county with a population of 4.8 million… they are scared as shit of the population voting. they dont allow voter initiatives for christ sake. “most free state” my ass. so they get to make the call; sabotage the economy and livability through bad policy to stop people from wanting to move here, sabotage the vote, or get kicked out of office.",1

4,"i still think there is a lot of merit to “let a bad idea compete and lose against a good idea”. we've faced some hurdles unfortunately. namely that debate between biden and trump. trump ployed biden into a stupid nonsensical conversation (the whole golf thing) and just made both candidates look undesirable which is the republican playbook at this point. republicans turn out to vote so they know they don't have to look good. they just have to turn off democrats, or remind their moderates why the other side is the wrong choice, which in that case worked. now that biden has stepped aside, we are seeing people drift towards kamala because she can avoid that more easily. she seems composed and democrats have been rallying around her better. it's why they don't want a debate between harris and trump.",2

84,"i think the people that make that the core of their political identity need to realize that “punishing” the democrats by voting third party or staying home or “hoping they learn their lesson” is a one way trip to both a trump presidency and a digit or two missing from the next estimate of the population of palestine. “but voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil!” yeah, no duh. that’s how democracy works. you get two choices. that’s it. the next president of the united states will either be kamala harris or donald trump. there is no other way this is going. so if you live in one of the seven states that actually matter (sorry maine and wyoming), you get to make a choice that either contributes to the victory of one of them or contributes to the victory of the other. that’s it. staying home is a choice that benefits one or the other. voting third party is a choice that benefits one or the other. actively discouraging voters by spreading “both sides” propaganda is a choice that benefits, well, only one. “but if we don’t hold their feet to the fire—“ you know who you have absolutely zero leverage over? donald trump. he’s not going to give even the smallest furry sliver of a rat’s ass what any leftwinger holding a sign at berkeley has to say about gaza. so if you think your freedom of protest can and should be used to leverage a presidential administration into doing something different on palestine before it’s too late, you literally only have one opportunity to do so and that’s a harris presidency. of the two of them, she is the only one that has even the slightest fragment of a chance of listening to public outcry and shaping us policy accordingly. there are a lot of progressives that are going to throw palestinians under the bus to make a point about how we’re throwing palestinians under a bus. if trump wins, netanyahu gets a blank check for four years. if harris wins, she might end up actually quite sucking on the subject, but she might actually do some good. zero good, zero chance, zero hope for palestine if trump gets in office.",0

33,"i want to be clear, because so many people don't understand us civics. there is no mechanism for that. the president does not control prosecutions. at most, he could secretly back channel an improper request for the ag to open an investigation, which biden would never do. trump probably did based on barr's response to questioning from senator harris. but the ag would be under no obligation to listen to him. judicial independence is an important part of our system that biden respects. and when you understand that, it makes trump whining about political persecution all the more absurd. the doj has gone extremely easy on trump, and people throughout the justice system are bending over backwards to protect him with procedural delays and in one case outright dismissal of serious charges (after absurd delays).",0

30,"that fanfiction trump wrote of an angered biden crashing the dnc to demand the nomination and challenge him to another debate is so telling on so many levels. first, it shows just how scared he is of a debate with harris. biden's standards were super low and he still missed them. as long as harris doesn't come across as stilted or scripted, she'd mop the floor with him, not allowing him a moment. i wouldn't be surprised if she approaches him with the prosecutor mindset, even so far as to give a ""mister trump, please answer the question"". second, it shows that he has no empathy outside of himself and is unable to be convinced of anything. to him, biden finally stepping down after weeks of pressure was a coup because he can't imagine himself doing the same. trump saw someone making an unselfish decision and admitted that, if he were in that situation, would never step down no matter the situation. trump's best point of attack is gone and isn't coming back, so he's reduced to imagining if he was still running against biden. i'm sure he'll find a new direction of attack against harris and walz, but until then it's funny and cathartic to watch a lifelong narcissist flail around when he thinks he might actually lose.",0

2,"i just do not understand that line, other than deliberately being dense. she only just became the official nominee, but she's been the presumptive since biden stepped down from running again. setting aside people having voted for biden/harris, people had almost two weeks to contact their various delegates if they had a problem with her. someone else could have run if the voters showed enough sign that they didn't want her. she wasn't a surprise.",2
16,"the media was at war with biden because he wouldn't play their game. he wouldn't sit down with the ny times, etc. so they retaliated by leaning in hard on the ""biden old"" narrative. is he old? yes. am i glad that he elevated harris? yes. did he have to go? no but he has lost a step or two. the media loves trump because he brings the eyeballs - lovers or haters, it matters not. biden is boring. which is a big fucking strength since real politics is boring.",0
32,"thanks for the response, this stuff needs to be seen more by people who still aren’t familiar with her. *and it will.* it’s been a crazy 10 days and things can change on a dime it seems. so far her campaign has been razor sharp at knowing exactly which levers to pull. i think the decision to not lead with telling her story has been a smart one. as she’s been meme’d for saying, she didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. she worked for the obama/biden campaign in 2007, was the district attorney out here in san francisco, was the attorney general for the state of california, and of course was a senator (before being tapped for vice president of the biden administration). her career/record speaks for itself, and i love that she’s been listing her credentials in speeches at rallies in the last week or so. and clearly it’s resonating with the people. if i had to guess i would say that her campaign’s approach to sharing her story, or getting into her identity, is something they know the american people will learn when they’re ready. she still needs to reach *a lot* of voters who are just getting caught up to the fact that biden stepped aside, you know? at the dnc when she gives her acceptance speech for the official nomination, maybe that’s when she’ll go into her background a little bit. when the most people are watching and in attendance. for now her message has been defending the current administration and explaining her role in it, listing her views on important issues (like women’s rights/abortion), and stressing why we can’t afford to suffer another term of the felon in office. i cannot say enough good things about how her campaign staff (which is literally just biden’s re-election campaign staff from a week or two ago haha) has handled her rollout.",1

[ “the federal government should have nothing to do with this issue. it’s being solved at the state level, and people are very happy about it,” trump [said in an interview]( with cbs news. “no regrets, no. i wouldn’t have regrets. i did something most people felt was undoable.” [ for the love of your friends, wives, sisters, daughters, go vote tomorrow.",1

8,"i checked that other sub right after the debate. they think while he didn’t have the best night, he did a pretty good job of weathering the storm, but also saw it as a missed opportunity to make some points. whatever points those are, i have no idea. kamala dog walked him right into saying all of the ridiculous things he says at his rallies. i’m pretty sure this was all of his greatest hits in such a short timespan. he doesn’t have any other points to make. kamala showed up to debate, trump showed up to get angry about things tv tells him not to like. while i’m not sure if this is anywhere near a knockout punch, the contrast is clearly drawn at this point.",0

22,"the fact that ""i saw it on television"" isn't being broadcast everywhere boggles my mind. it's the best campaign fodder i've ever seen. even if it makes the kamala camp look mean, it also makes trump look weak and incompetent. it was a brilliant moment of indefensible, shallow, stupidity that sums up what everyone outside of maga knows trump to be.",0
29,"perhaps his supporters need some hand-holding to guide them through the logic of this thing? like her or hate her, harris will still be gone in four, eight years tops. trump's legacy of being the first convicted criminal – a recidivist criminal at that – to occupy the white house, however, will stain the history of the republican party and this country for ages. these people see themselves as patriots, for crying out loud. i just don't get it.",1

55,"\*cracks knuckles* ok, let's give writing this new tagline a shot! ctrl-f ""joe biden"" ctrl-r ""kamala harris"" ""here's why this is bad for ~~joe biden~~ kamala harris"" **pulitzer, here we come!**",1
11,bret baier is preparing a completely different set of documents to ask kamala about.,2
104,"doesn't everyone already assume she's a harris supporter, as are most of her fans? might be able to turn out a few more voters, but i'm not sure this moves the needle much.",1
8,w endorsing harris isn't gonna do a thing for magats. my brother in law was air national guard and he was deployed to the middle east. he absolutely loathes w and thinks neocons are warmongers (he's not wrong). he's also the biggest trump supporter around and thinks that the man's shit doesn't stink. he can do wrong in his eyes.,2
13,"maga pretending they wouldn’t be in an uproar if biden or kamala said the same thing lol “but but he didn’t mean it! he obviously means that he will fix the country so well christian’s will never need to vote again! “ lmao just admit that’s what you actually want, we all know already it’s not a secret.",0
241,"hispanic here, south texas region. trump has never been remotely close to get my vote, all harris need to do is not mess up and she will get more hispanic votes than trump.",0
13,"the day after the 2016 election my sister called and asked how i was, and i burst into tears and said there's no place for me - a disabled woman - in my own country anymore. he's going to take my health care away. i mean, i was just sobbing on the phone with her. this year i was getting ready for a repeat but now with kamala, i feel so much more energized and thrilled with her candidacy.",1
2,"as much as i enjoy former staffers and administration officials signing a letter, unfortunately in this day and age it doesn’t mean anything unless they all come together in one large press conference and all at once denounce trump, endorse kamala and take questions as to why. otherwise it just a buried news article that a low level trump staffer says they’re lying and then the press moves on.",0
126,"the same guy called blm protestors terrorists. who described inner cities as hell holes. who questioned kamala's citizenship years ago, and obama's before hers.",2
9,he won’t be able to do it because kamala’s just gonna do the normal thing of walking over to him for a handshake in the middle each time. (which was what trump was supposed to do instead of rushing over to his podium.),0
94,"he’s talked about how when he voted to convict trump and spoke out against him after january 6th that him and his family would get tons of death threats. i’d love if he would endorse harris, but i understand wanting to prioritize the safety of his family.",2
81,"he should shore up his flagging hannibal lecter front by pushing hard against kamala’s laugh, and maybe open up a new front against her position on labrador retriever puppies being adorable. that will fix her wagon right good and proper! maybe have a coup de gras filming steven cheung screaming abuse at a nine month old yellow labrador puppy. don’t even need to do any leg work. steven does that every thursday morning with his neighbor’s dog!",2
5,yes! keep the smackdown raining on that man-child. mala: make america laugh again kamala all the way!,1

12,"trump: ""kamala is dumb as a rock!"" these women: ""squak! dumb as a rock! squak! dumb as a rock!""",0
2,"i've watched my conservative friends twist themselves into all sorts of contortions regarding the us. the funny thing is, despite them being intellectual types who ""aren't republicans"", they're ideas are typically predicated by movements in popular republican ideology. i mean, what an astounding coincidence that they're second guessing the wisdom of democracy now that we have a former president (who they say they disprove of) who wants to be a dictator and a would-be vice president who quotes political theorists (read: fascist ideological pundits) who think the us needs a dictator rather than a president. most all of their tortured smarty smart opinions and philosophies end up simply being recycled bottom of the barrel republican talking points dressed up with circuitous semi-philosophical reasoning. it's weird (ok it's fucking creepy and scary!) seeing smart, thoughtful people manipulated so easily by the lowest common denominator.",1
5,"jd vance is, like, the 3rd best team mate on team harris/walz. we can’t let that guy sit on the bench.",2
194,"oh, team kamala is chopping up today's rally footage like a prep cook at the busiest restaurant on valentine's day.",2
55,"just wait, they’re really driving in the knife later:",2
3,"i don't care about national polling: >according to election analyst and statistician nate silver, while harris is more likely to win the popular vote, trump has a greater chance of winning the electoral college. trump is essentially tied with kamala in swing states. i want to see her pull ahead with electoral college projections before i start breathing a sigh of relief. do not let headlines like these make you think the dems have this in the bag.",0
11,"glad i found this post. i operate a sawmill in australia. i was passively listening to it today. after i heard kamala go for the jugular on rallies and then trump lose it on eating cats i was like.... thats enough sawmilling for today.. sorry to all my customers that wanted lumber this afternoon, i was witnessing a 235th trimester murder",0
40,"i don't think she sways many independent right-wing leaning swing voters either. on morning joe, they did a focus group where they had right-wing swing voters, and their opinions of harris were not high. i think the key thing for her is to ignore the repubclian vote altogether. this race is going to be about turnout. she really needs to get as many people in her base to turn out and as many left leaning swing voters to turn out. if she can do that, then she wins, if she doesn't, then trump wins.",0
33,"this might be conspiracy theory me. but with the crowds that kamala is pulling then pictures of the rapists crowds, i don’t think his ego will let him keep campaigning if she’s pulling larger crowds. he’s been campaigning for 4 fuckin years. why stop now?",0
8,yep. this is the same flawed logic behind magas thinking we worship biden like they do their guy (and hence were surprised to hear how many of us were actually *not* upset when he dropped out of the race) and also how many of them think that a lack of harris signs must mean that she isn't popular (combined with the fact that many of them are still being printed).,2
3,harris should fill the time instead.,2
24,"apparently, there are some internal memos suggesting the republicans are worried the woman vote is gonna murder them. i also thought i read somewhere there was some evidence to support the idea of trump paying for polls that make him look stronger than he is. either way, i havent have a lot of faith in polls since 2016. i never thought biden was in a bad as a place as was in. polls have consistently said one thing, while the results at the ballot box have said another. regardless i'm excited for the harris switch because of thr energy it brings. i want this win to be big and it's feeling like it's moving that way.",1
5,"legit, my mom saw harris and biden on tv a couple years back and my mom goes “look at her. just standing there.” my mom can’t even stand for harris to exist and stand there lol.",2
4,"conservatives 3 weeks ago: ""why are you hiding harris! she's too scared! she knows she is going to lose!"" conservatives today: \*fucking crickets* not a cult, everyone.",2
328,dick already said he's voting for kamala so we have all the presidents,1
5,"it's a game of numbers at this point and pennsylvania will yield harris more electoral votes, so she should go with shapiro. beshear is useless because she can't win kentucky. we white women will be voting for her anyway because we don't want to live in gilead.",1
3,robinson's negative coattails could deliver north carolina to harris.,2
54,"he's going to blame the crooked stage, the lighting, gravity, air drafts, harris' arm length and windmills",2
8,"he mentioned vibes on the white dudes for harris call too, so i suspect we're going to hear this as a consistent theme - that's good because consistency is critical.",2
14,fox is going to complain so hard that it's not fair that kamala gets to preside over it,2
79,"apparently he said in his interview with harris and her vetting team that he wasn’t planning on running for the presidency in the future, which was seen as a plus by them since it’s less likely he’d be trying to upstage her. also one of the things that turned them off to shapiro, who seemed to be much more personally ambitious and wanted an expanded vp scope impossible to know how much he really meant that or if his feelings will change in the future, but definitely the right interview answer",2
4,"media won't cover this, but too busy talking about how harris isn't polling at 90%>>>",2
507,the owner said he did it for his daughter who blames harris/biden for the situation in gaza. i don't believe that is the (only) reason why they pulled the endorsement.,2
11,"yeah i had this discussion with people worried it would boost him and i basically told em exactly that, no one is suddenly going to view trump in a different light, especially when it was revealed the shooter was a republican. honestly i think it’s only going to get worse for trump, as kamala and her team have gone opposite on biden’s “gentleman” approach and are full on blasting the republicans, and it’s exciting people far more i had anticipated. my take: while we’re still a few months from the election, without something to drag kamala for, she’s only going to build momentum and win the presidency. republicans will probably recognize this and begin pivoting harder into the “stolen election” take while trying to basically cheat their way through the state level (be it electors or bs laws to tangle up the voting) and then ask the sc to basically anoint trump similar to bush and gore. but if kamala crushes i think even this corrupt af sc will see the writing on the wall and back off.",1
29,the harris campaign should turn this into a trolling tweet.,0
25,even if she’s off by the maximum 7 points from moe it still indicates a decisive win for harris,2
5,"just getting young people to vote can pay dividends. encouraging republicans who dislike trump not to vote is a win too. some right wingers just can’t vote kamala, to which i say, just don’t vote",0
3,"i love all the press kamala is doing. 60 minutes, proving she can take hard questions. howard stern, going after a bigger audience. stephen colbert and having a beer with him. the view, oprah. etc. while trump hasn’t done anything or hasn’t tried to get swing voters or anything just going back to a base he already has. he’s afraid of anyone criticizing him and afraid of people not liking him.",0
134,"damn, that really was a solid line. absolutely love the direction this campaign is taking where they aren't pulling punches. no idea how trump or vance can face either of these two in a debate without stooping to insanely low levels that will certainly lose any fringe supporters. first i was skeptical of harris but that was quickly diminished. then i was certain it should be kelly and that is evaporated as well seeing walz in action. nothing against kelly i was just totally unfamiliar with walz.",0
7,"i've been saying this but elections are decided on literal vibes. vibes about the economy, the candidates, etc. if you can effectively communicate a clear simple message and frame your opponent in a negative light you're going to do well. harris having speeches that are a tight 20 while still taking several shots at trump are going to be absurdly effective. she was a prosecutor, she knows how to make an argument.",0
4,how did james cameron turn evil and arnold the repub-inator give kamala the thumbs-up? the fucking facts do not uphold alternative reality,2
3,"my thoughts, exactly. but, presuming harris wins in november and is the incumbent in '28, pete has to be on the shortlist for the '32 nomination. i'm gonna pull the lever for pete in this racist hellhole grinning like spongebob learning that squidward likes krabbie patties.",2
97,the irony of that woman saying kamala harris isn't smart.,2
9,"i'm not actually convinced it is. i think the polls are missing something. but even if they were off by double digits, it'd still be too much support for this shit. trump could lose 20 million supporters, harris could get a 1984 style blowout, and trump would still end up with 50+ million voters... that's the problem. and even if i am bullish on our chances, i know it's going to probably be a lot closer than that.",0
4,"stop talking about it. it's a (*literal*) [dead cat strategy]( every minute you're taking about haitians not eating cats you're letting trump and vance dictate the narrative, you're doing nothing to put off maga voters (who find the very existence of the argument invigorating and credibility-generating), and you're *not* talking about trump's age and trump and vance's weirdness and social awkwardness that's really harming them with undecided voters. harris isn't winning because he spends all her time rebutting trump - that's what clinton did, and it failed miserably. harris is winning because she *laughs once* at stupid trump gambits in a derisory way and then *totally ignores them* and carries on making the case that trump is old and weird and pathetic to voters. trump wants attention, and he wants it on the things he chooses. if you want to hurt him, *stop focusing on those things* - dismiss them and move back to talking about the things he *really fucking hates* everyone concentrating on",0
17,all kamala has to say is that “he won’t debate me cause he has a smaller crowd size”. that’ll rile him up lmfao,2
860,"first the los angeles times ( and now this. i've unsubscribed from both. what papers are all of you subscribing to, because i feel like we are running out of legitimate options.",2
57,"mid millennial with a ton of taylor fans as friends, most if not all were already voting for kamala. i think she needs to galvanize gen z",2
53,"“the most recent poll showed 56% of registered voters agreed with a statement that harris, 59, was ""mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges,"" compared to 49% who said the same of trump, 78. only 22% of voters assessed biden that way.” oof.",2
27,> but every woman i know found him deeply creepy and offputting and if this election is won by harris i truly think it will be because of woman and the youth! go out in vote in mass numbers and ya'll got this. this coming from a white man who is voting harris.,2
3,stack court to 13 so kamala can finish the job,1
24,i think biden realized he couldn’t do another term months ago and they spent all that time lying to the public while behind the scenes setting up all of plans and ensuring everyone circles the wagon. they let trump run on biden being old for months. and they continue to show a strategic and united front. and they keep doing underhanded stuff…it’s like they fuvking know what trump and his campaign are like and are letting them play themselves. they knew trump’s campaign would act like obama not endorsing her was something to bring up to highlight internal division…so they waited til they brought it up and then hours later release a ridiculously cheesy and staged support video. which was amazing and came off as caring and genuine. they let trump choose an absolutely useless vp. and in theory one of the only reasons vance might have been a good vp because he’s allegedly this white straight laced old school conservative and they felt the base would like the “contrast” between him and kamala as vp.,2
14,"it’s not what kamala thinks, drumpf thinks he’s a fascist and keeps telling us he is!",0
199,"that’s definitely a statement that comes from a position of strength. i think they are legitimately trying to emulate kamala and be witty and off the wall i guess for lack of a better term, but they fundamentally misunderstand why the sarcasm works coming from her campaign. i think the first bullet point they should really work on is the swearing. even in today’s political climate, “shit” and “shitty” hold a different meaning than saying damn or hell, it’s like a tier higher on the “unacceptable swears.” i think this will be very offputting. of course if you still are questioning who to support after everything he’s done you likely are looking for an excuse to justify voting for trump, and at a minimum this doesn’t do that.",0
16,i hope he makes a run for the white house after kamala’s two terms.,1
14,"i saw an anti-kamala ad on tv at work a bit ago that said she was ""*dangerously* liberal"" and it reminded me about how fucking far gone the gop is. i really hope we can get back to a place where politicians act with some professionalism.",2
19,"well.. to be fair kamala provided the laugh track at certain parts. it definitely made his responses more hype, just not in the right way.",2
230,"the best thing for kamala to do is to effectively grey rock. don't say anything stupid, don't make an outrageous gaffe, don't react to any of trump's bullshit, and don't attack him. the best way to beat trump right now is to act like he doesn't exist. let him beat himself.",1
5,"i will admit, in the days/weeks before biden -officially- left the race, i was hesitant about kamala to say the least. i just didnt think she would be able to garner enough public support, but boy was i wrong! it is great to see the base so energized finally. i hope, hope, hope we can ride it all the way to november... please vote!",1
1,"today in the nyt, ""nyt endorses harris"" also in the nyt, ""nyt endorsement craters harris campaign""",2
3,"yeah exactly. classy, don't make a big deal out of it directly. the moderator can introduce both, vance displaying an empty podium. then walz and procedure to either answer questions or whatever with that. don't call him a coward right there, save all that for the rally. but attack the opposing parties positions. nobody can whine about him criticizing their policy positions and fear mongering, project 2025, etc. anybody can simply ask ""well why weren't they there to defend it?"" the news cycle will be talking about it. places like snl will make skits about it. jon stewart will go on about it. harris/walz can shit on them in the rallies. i will admit though, it would be pretty hilarious if the only thing walz said after the introductions was ""i guess he couldn't get off the couch"". i would laugh, but he probably should save that for the rally too lmao.",0
14,"""kamala harris uses bronzer!""",1
102,why not a harris vs trump shooting match? fuck it! a walz vs vance and harris vs trump shooting match? it feels so fucking american that it just might fucking work.,0
4,the best part of all of this is that their panic about kamala came after their convention. which means that the only way they could get rid of trump would be if he volunteers to drop out. which is just impossible. he would never. he’s too greedy and craven.,0
180,"thank you. one of the most annoying trends in this election cycle is the amount of maga coverage saying ""desantis believes"" and ""trump's position on [child care / abortion / two-state solution]..."" these people have no concrete beliefs (none that they espouse or abide by politically). they are opportunists. desantis wanted desperately to be president; imagine how he would react if he was trying to assist with disaster relief of a southern state and the governor refused to speak with him for political reasons. i'm a floridian. if he has a talk with kamala harris and they do some kind of joint statement where she asks people to donate not to her campaign this week but to some kind of relief fund, that would generate millions in minutes. this is reprehensible.",1
67,right? i'm canadian. i'd much rather have ms. harris esq. over the racist rapist to be in charge of our neighbours to the south.,2
2,"it pisses me off to no end that when you ask a republican why they are voting for trump, they will say ""he's better for the economy"" or something to that effect. except tons of economists have said kamala's plan is better and that trump is terrible for the economy. in fact, democrats have always been (since nixon at least) better for the economy than republicans. but rather than believe that all republicans are just that uninformed, i'm convinced that the economy isn't actually their priority. but most republicans won't admit that they actually just hate poc, lgbt (especially the t), and women. nothing else makes sense to me.",0
3,"it'll embolden the ones already voting for trump and outrage those against him. whoever this ""undecided"" voter at this point is an ashamed trump voter who, at best, will abstain. at worst, they'll just vote for trump. both covered by a dozen excuses why ""i don't agree with trump but harris/democrats...""",0
6,called it weeks ago. i said then that biden's replacement benefits from being on stage torching trump and that trump would refuse to debate because of it. harris should get the debate venue for a speech and town hall.,2
32,"it will continue on in jd vance. the vice presidential debate seems to have sealed that. jd is basically demonstrated a new way forward, trump who says the ugly shit in charismatic ways. which is going to be epic as trump will be alive when that transition happens, and ho-le-sheit will that be a battle between them. :p",2
3325,"honestly i was a bit of a biden drop-out doubter, since i thought incumbency was too big of an advantage to throw away, but i am so happy that i was wrong. the energy around kamala harris is unlike anything i’ve ever seen. i have never seen people this excited and fired up before. we still have to put in the work obviously, but i’m feeling so much better about our chances of beating trump now.",1
33,"honestly, this might be the best case scenario. biden is fantastic at being president, less so running for president. kamala seems to have learned a lot in the past 4 years and was ready to f*cking go. she's eating up the internet game while also bringing apathetic democrats and some moderates back into the fold with remarkable speed. now, biden gets to hold down the fort and focus all his efforts on making america as fantastic as possible as a lame duck president. and she gets to focus solely on campaigning and kicking trump's ass. biden can now do what he does best - do good for america and make the dems look awesome. and kamala can go out and make trump look old and incompetent. truly a dyanmic duo.",0
12,"while i wouldn't be surprised if that ended up happening, i'm just picturing the mental gymnastic that conservatives will perform in order to defend that. it's a shame and extremely disappointing that we already know that they'll finding some way to defend it. here's what they'll probably end up saying: ""kamala was egging him on!"" ""it was a mistake, a slip up"" ""antifa and hunter biden used ai on his laptop to alter trump's words in real-time, making it sound like he said the n-word"" ""based"" ""well whatabout when biden sniffed his daughters hair?!?!"" ""kamala is the real racist!""",2
95,since we switched from biden to harris it feels like suddenly the democratic party knows how to fight and message. i’m loving it.,1
20,"yes, agree! for the 13 years he served in the house of representatives, he served a mainly rural area. he was voted 7th most bipartisan member of congress. his 1st child was conceived via ivf, something that the magats and other far right crazies (and probably alito and thomas) want to ban. that child is named hope. this should be the other part of their campaign message in addition to “we won’t go back”, but also what this team of harris and walz will bring us: “hope and joy”!! go harris-walz 2024!! 🌴🥥🐈💙💙🇺🇸🇺🇸",1

4,was listening to a podcast by former bbc reporters yesterday. it went something like this: “trump’s former cos called him a fascist. anderson cooper asks harris if she agrees. she does. why this is bad for harris and just shows she does not know how to attack trump properly.” literally zero time spent discussing whether or not trump is a fascist and why this is bad for democracy. the press have a lot to answer for in helping bring this country to the point it’s at. but we know full well no self-reflection will happen.,0

898,i'm sorry for the loss of your relationship with your mother. my father used to support trump in 2016 though not more than just voting for him. he sat out 2020 and this year him and my mother are both voting against trump because what happened is he is seeing how trump's campaign and propaganda has ruined his father's mind. my mother also previously wasn't political at all but leaned liberal while my father leaned republican but now that my mother is retired she is all in on kamala and has gotten my dad into politics even if only to be against trump. they are both non-practicing catholics (father former baptist) but they live in tennessee so ultimately it doesn't matter.,1

42,"the thing that concerns me most about the past decade of politics is the aggressive attempt of the right-wing to delegitimize education and expertise, and put opinion on the same level as provable facts. trump has an expiration date, but once he's gone his post-truth maga base will still be around, passing their hivemind opinions around as if they will become truth if they repeat them often enough. case in point--if you were to ask trump voters, they would say that inflation is exploding right now despite the fact that it's back to very normal levels. what they really want is *deflation* back to 2010 prices, but they didn't pay enough attention in school to know what inflation and deflation actually mean. but kamala will lose votes because the narrative for much of the country is that the president controls prices, kamala has evidently been president for 4 years, and inflation is skyrocketing. and, as long as that 30% of the country all agree on and repeat the same false opinions, it really doesn't matter that it's false because the impact on elections, policies, etc. is the same. and we all have to live with these people moving forward, long after trump is buried on hole 3 of trump national.",0

32,"yep. when the democrats go ""hey, trump himself said he'd be dictator on day one"", the republicans turn around and go ""woah, woah, woah, that's violent rhetoric and it's going to get someone killed!"" meanwhile, trump constantly calls harris a ""fascist, communist, socialist, marxist"" and says she is destroying the country, has destroyed the country, and the world will be destroyed by world war 3 if she's elected. but no, calling out trump's own words is apparently a step too far over the divisive line for them.",0
88,"obviously his statements about the election are the most shocking and important part of this speech. even if it’s “just a joke” (which is what he’ll claim), it’s still a gross thing to even joke about as a presidential candidate. imagine the reaction if kamala joked about this. on a different, less serious note, did anyone hear the part of the speech where trump seems to say “i’m not a christian”? i think i maybe misheard him (he slurs his words a lot), but if he really did say that he’s not a christian then that’s a really bizarre thing for him to confess given his supporter base.",0

[trump on ‘poisoning the blood’ remarks: ‘i never knew that hitler said it’]( [how trump’s rhetoric compares with hitler’s]( well before trump out and out expressed his simpatico with *der führer,* throughout his 9 years in u.s. politics trump has frequently used language straight out of dictator 101: * calling the u.s. news media “the enemy of the people”—excluding, of course,selected maga-minded press outlets that grant trump fawningly positive coverage, such as fox news channel and the fringe oann (one america news network) * calling it “treason” for democratic lawmakers not applauding during his state of the union speeches , * calling in the wake of racial justice protests of george floyd’s murder by police officer derek chauvin for *protesting to be outlawed.* * calling for *making it illegal to criticize trump’s judicial appointees* —namely u.s. district judge aileen cannon, assigned to oversee trump’s trial on stealing and mishandling classified top secret documents. cannon has been widely criticized for blatant favoritism toward trump in this case, ensuring that trump would not go to trial before the nov. 5 election. trump’s desire to be a dictator is blatantly exemplified by the fact his favorite world leaders are all dictators—murderous tyrants like vladimir putin of russia and kim jong un of north korea and democracy-loathing autocrats like viktor orbán of hungary and jair bolsonaro of brazil. trump’s association with hitler is entirely self-perpetuated and as it turns out ,4trump’s vile rhetoric was just the tip of the fascist-fawning iceberg.",0

13,"trump's history shows that this is not the case. in both primaries, but especially in 2016, trump was allowed to attack other candidates while the frontrunners against him were too afraid to directly attack him back. he got to just land blows and scoop up voters as he knocked people out of the race. hilary's mistake was in attacking his voters, not just him. that's one reason why the weird line is landing so much better than deplorables. it doesn't directly attack his voters, it attacks conservative politicians and commentators, and it gives voters an out and a reason to not vote for trump. the other big problem is harris might not be able to afford a close win. we know that republicans have set up chicanery to steal the election in certain states. the bigger the margin, the harder it will be for those tactics to be triggered or taken seriously. she needs to run up the score and that means staying on the attack. at some point, probably after the dnc, she needs to pivot to making an affirmative case for herself. but she should never stop reminding people that trump is a weird, old criminal who is not fit for the office and will do terrible things if elected.",0

8,"harris throws out some innocuous stump talk where she relates to voters through having worked ordinary jobs and trump responds by staging some fry kitchen theater for an afternoon at a mcdonald's that closed for his visit, as if the question was, _is my candidate physically and mentally capable of working a drive-thru window?_ yep, his voters will surely think he flipped the script on her, while completely missing the point of her campaign rhetoric that really was nothing remarkable to begin with and not worth spending any amount of time on. but hey, us getting coerced into talking about stupid shit that doesn't matter has been the theme of all three of trump's candidacies.",0
57,"honestly, part of me thought that was going to win him the election at the time and i was very surprised he wasn't milking it more than he is. like he *is* totally milking it, but not to nearly the degree i thought he would be. i think the fact they couldn't effectively spin it as an attack on the democrats since the shooter was a republican is probably the reason why. there's also the fact he did not receive the universal pity he probably thought he would, too. i mean, the democrats were able to steal so much thunder from him with biden just dropping out and kamala stepping right in. that says everything really lol.",1
3,"the same way you get a handful of lgbt people (mostly gay men, but not exclusively) who will vote for him. or jewish people, or any other minority. hell, plenty of white ladies are still voting for this guy, despite the fact that his last term has led to situations where women are almost dying from ectopic pregnancies and the like because of these abortion bans. and i just saw some article with muslims from michigan swearing they were going to vote for trump because they didn't like harris' position on israel (no, i don't get that logic at all, either). there's nothing new under the sun, as the saying goes.",0

72,"the ratings make me beam because of all things i just know that’s what will piss trump off the most. he has always been obsessed with ratings and having the most people and exaggerating those when they don’t meet what he expected. he must be absolutely raging to see her packed rally’s, skyrocketing ratings and raising polls. i hope a record number of people tune into kamala harris’s abc debate without him because that will infuriate him!",1

105,i’m in the blue dot in nebraska and hope we’ll help see harris in the wh,2
118,the whole point of this was to further his misinformation campaign so he could look at the camera and say that line about how he worked there longer than kamala. anyone with an iq above room temperature would have seen that coming a mile away at mcdonalds corporate and they gave him a platform for lies. that bullshit that they don’t endorse politics is laughable since that is absolutely what they did. they want to say its fine because they invited the harris campaign but unless mcdonalds plans to confirm her employment it doesn’t serve the same purpose. i emailed corporate and told them they say their last dollar from me. until they apologize and said this was a mistake; we’ll drive further for our early ski breakfast and late night snack runs.,2

8,> hopefully harris gives fucking garland the boot and appoints an ag with some fucking guts. he's been slow-walking so much it's impossible to distinguish between incompetence and ~~collusion~~ malice. if she doesn't replace him there might not be an america left. we need an ag as highly aggressive as he is competent.,2
51,"i tried to reply to a claim on the conservative sub earlier. just wanted to see what would happen if you tried to very politely question some of the rhetoric. i never stated affilitation, but i made a response to claims that kamala was obnoxious for saying 'you know what i mean.' i said that a journalist covering politics denying knowledge of trump's statements, which have been said on camera, was odd. and then made a point about journalism being a search for clarity, and denying knowledge of an event to avoid scrutiny is not a way to do that. just to clarify this is not verbatim - i'd say the way i phrased it was less blunt but that was the point i was getting across within minutes the comment was removed. fair enough it's a conservative sub, but when they feel the need to remove politely expressed facts it tells you all you need to know",0

148,"because on paper she is similar to what trump ran on in 2016. 1). new to the front stage of politics, clean slate. 2). goes on the attack 3). more charisma than her opponent 4). media likes posting stories of her trump is mad she is beating him at his own game and that his usual insults haven't worked. he also finally acknowledged that the 'weird' attacks are working. the public likes to trash people like harris and h. clinton, but they **love** watching a famous person implode more. get the popcorn ready for november and through yo jan when harris certifies her own win. edit: format.",1

3,kamala can't do shit without a majority house and senate so vote for more than her.,0
5,"i think what's really going on is trump's handlers have info that he is losing very badly with young voters. normally that wouldn't be an issue, as young people rarely turn out to vote, but this year seems to be bucking that trend. so now they're playing up his reality tv persona by parading him around in increasingly ridiculous ways, then pumping social media with clips of him being ""hilarious"" and ""based."" the sad thing is, it's probably working. there are so, so many young people who don't care about politics and only vote for people they like. harris is an excellent candidate, but she's a politician. trump is an unserious clown with no shame. he's aiming for the lowest common denominator, like he always has.",0

85,i’m pretty sure undecided voters are just trump friendly voters that feel bad about their inclinations. you have the most polarizing incumbent in us history and the sitting vice president. there’s nothing to “learn” about the candidates. if you’re undecided you’re either not very serious or lying to yourself. edit you can see this is the example given. the lady wants us to be “civil” and less “high school” because she wants people to stop highlighting what a shit heel threat trump is because it makes *her* feel bad about what she wants to do.,0
