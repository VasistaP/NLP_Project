85,"is there any internal discussions about how fact checking both candidates without any context normalizes trump and gives the impression that both sides are somehow on equal grounds when it comes to factual information? for instance harris will get fact checked because she's little off on some number or slightly exaggerated as all politicians can do at times. meanwhile trump is still talking about stolen elections and making up crazy stuff like people eating pets. things that are just flat out made up. the take away from the average reader then is just that both candidates lie and your fact checking becomes pointless. you'll constantly see something along of the lines of ""see they're both liars"". they completely miss the context of seeing just how much more frequently trump lies and how outrageous the actual lies are. how can this better be addressed by fact checkers?",0
12,"reputations are hard to maintain and easy to lose. when we see statements like this, it really devalues the goal of politifacts, by splitting hairs so thin and what objectively feels like the wrong direction. is there any concerns about this? ""biden said trump wants to cut medicare. mostly false. when he was president, trump released annual budgets that proposed cutting medicare but he has repeatedly pledged throughout the 2024 presidential campaign that he will not cut the program.""",0
9,"i have seen a lot of fact checks on harris and biden recently that claim a statement they are making is ""false"" simply because trump never explicitly *said* that he would do the thing that biden or harris is claiming would happen. in these instances, it feels like you are really giving trump's word or even lack of word a lot of weight, when he's proven in many instances that he is a liar and will often do the opposite of what he says he will do. in that case it feels really corny to spend any breath saying that a claim made about trump's plan, on abortion for example, is ""false"" because he never *said* he would go for a national abortion ban. it takes us for absolute idiots to believe that isn't in the cards should he win. wouldn't it make sense to distinguish between a **claim** and a statement of fact? a claim is essentially an assertion that something is true, and doesn't necessarily mean it's a lie (as long as the speaker believes it).",0
8,"is there pressure to try to balance out the fact checks? for example, if you fact check 10 misleading our outright false things trump says in any given speech, do you feel you have to find something, anything, that harris says so that you appear to be as unbiased as possible?",2
2,"thanks for taking the time and welcome. 1) how many true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, false, and pants on fire statements has donald trump made in his lifetime per politifact? 2) do you think we will soon have reliable fact-checking in real-time with the help of ai? how, if at all, does politifact currently use ai?",2
2,"i was just scrolling through politifact yesterday, and i did have a question. has there been a significant increase in misinformation this year over previous election years? just curious if there is any empirical data to quantify it, or even just anecdotal. it seems like a majority of statements rated are ""mostly false"" or lower (especially for trump, who appeared to have only had a single statement rated ""mostly true"" or higher in the last year), but i'm curious if that's because the amount of true statements is far lower this year, versus an editorial choice to prefer to correct false statements. thank you for your work. i still can't believe my mom's friend 8 years ago who rejected your site as ""biased"" and chose to believe some terrible misinformation from some pundit on fox news instead. it's been a nightmare trying to navigate a world like that, and i am glad independent groups like you are trying to be a beacon of light.",1
1,in another comment you stated that you've rated harris 65 times and trump 1069 times. how do you work to dispel the notion from trump supporters that these numbers simply mean that you're targeting trump and trying to make him look bad? or that you're simply cherry picking off the cuff comments from trump and ignoring similar comments from harris? do you actually see positive engagement from trump supporters? have you seen your fact checking actually raise awareness and affect the views of people that are already predisposed to a certain candidate?,0
1,"question: is the various forms of media (not foreign influenced) equally discussed between democrats & republicans overall. seems fox, right side, etc is 100% trump. msnbc, cnn, abc, nbc, cbs are for harris. pbs is supposed to be middle…in exposure of information to ppl seems european (bbc) & al jazeera tries to be more - just the facts. am i wrong?",2
33,"josie here: thanks for your feedback. context is everything, and very often we focus on the context in which a claim is made to decide a) whether we want to fact-check it or b) how we rate the claim. without keeping count, we try to select facts to check from both democrats and republicans. at the same time, we more often fact-check people who repeatedly make attention-getting or misleading statements. correcting the record is important – it’s what fact-checking was conceived of to do. (that being said, [true claims]( can be super interesting, too.) although it’s a bit of a gimmick, the pants on fire rating is meaningful, and we hope readers glean the weight of a claim that we classify not only just false but “ridiculous and false."" accountability is important, and thanks for calling out the “records” of politicians’ claims. we like to highlight our truth-o-meter scorecards for people. anyone who is fact-checked on politifact.com gets one of these pages (because our website is a database), so readers can review all of the different fact-checks we’ve done on politicians and pundits. for the purposes of this pre-election day chat, here are the politifact scorecards for former president donald trump and vice president kamala harris.[we’ve rated harris 65 times.]( rated trump 1069 times]( [here’s a link to our politifact faqs for more information on these kinds of questions. ](",0
13,"josie here: what’s up olive juice! i am from nc and i love olives so much so i have to respond. also this is a great question. like what sets us apart from the folks just googling things?! first, i’ll say that there are some key ways that journalists/fact-checkers go about that initial google search that starts us out on the right foot. ([these are also strategies that non-journalists can use in their search)]( we’ll research a claim, the person/account who made it and see what pops up. 1. who is behind the information? 2. what is the evidence? 3. what do other sources say? very often, a simple search of a claim (ex. [what did trump do with the affordable care act]( will pop up many news articles (or even fact-checks) that will give you the information you need. very often, that information can point us fact-checkers toward the right sources and data to start writing a fact-check. something that an average person likely wouldn’t do is then contact often 5+ experts from across the political spectrum to talk either over the phone or email and answer some specific questions about the information. that’s what we do at politifact. that diversity of sources is key to getting a measured view of the issue. politifact uses on-the-record interviews and publishes a list of sources with every fact-check. when possible, the list includes links to sources that are freely available, although some sources rely on paid subscriptions (lexis nexis, some subscriber-only news subscriptions). the goal is to help readers judge for themselves whether they agree with the ruling. as far as the review, politifact reporters submit their fact-check for a first read by a main editor, then it is second-read by another editor and a copy editor. [more about our process of review and rating here.](",0
5,"ellen: i think it really depends on what kind of an event it is that we’re fact-checking. our reporters listen to *a lot* of speeches and interviews by the candidates, and they get very familiar with their stump speeches. when it comes to a major rally, we’ve usually heard and fact-checked whatever a candidate is repeating, so we’re listening for anything new or newsworthy. for live fact-checking a debate, it’s a similar process, but we spend a lot of time before hand prepping things we suspect the candidates might say. (not to brag, but our team doc to prep for the trump-harris debate was 100+ pages long.) one group on our team works on immediately sharing what we have prepped on social media or [our live blog,]( while another group starts working on new claims that come up so we can get a [fact-check]( out quickly. and then there’s big breaking news events, like the baltimore bridge collapse or the trump assassination attempt in july or hurricane helene or election day, where we can’t really prepare. breaking news can create an information gap as everyone is scrambling to get answers, and social media loves to fill that gap with misinformation. in these cases, we’re often in triage mode, trying to address the most serious, harmful or prevalent misinformation spreading online. that includes things like false claims about [fema aid]( might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting]( it can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; for example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities. but during breaking news, we’re more concerned about getting it right than getting it first.",0
3,you can look up the previous election forecasts. 538 has theirs still online. they had biden winning 90/100 and trump winning 10/100. this year they have trump winning 53/100 and kamala 47/100.,0
2,"josie here: while false repeat!! your username is scary to us!! but false statements often get repeated :( 1. you may see all of our fact-checking of former president donald trump here, broken down by their rating: [ 2. right now, there is some exciting ai training work by fact-checkers across the world ([ and others) that is looking to use trained ai models to spot misinformation and find “repeat offenders” in a way. the software links up our fact-checks to new claims. we’ve played around with it. we’d still want to vet what the ai model brings up, to see if the software is calling up accurate connections. very often, a new claim is said in a similar way as an old one (not the exact same way) that would lead us to want to review the facts and maybe do a new fact-check. we’d like to do more real-time fact-checking (with ai or not) for big events, but very often candidates are [not interested in participating in a debate with our live fact-checking. ]( guess the answer is, wait and see! thanks for your questions!",0
9,"josie here: i can talk a little bit about some of the themes we’ve seen when it comes to misinformation about lgbtqia+ issues. we have a reporter on staff, grace abels, who leads up a lot of this coverage: [ it gets into a lot of those questions you raised. i can call out some salient checks and stories: [would mo abortion amendment 3 legalize surgery for trans kids? it's highly unlikely, experts say]( [harris’ support for prisoner access to transgender surgery aligns with federal law and court rulings]( [where trump and biden stand on key lgbtq+ issues]( (old but relevant) in a variety of competitive races this election cycle, [republican-aligned groups have appealed to voters]( who are uncomfortable with transgender participation in sports, hoping to depress support for democratic candidates. stepping back to a big picture, as far as a trend, there has been a resurgence of portraying queer people as child predators: this is true for republican lawmakers in congress and statehouse which makes it more mainstream. [this has had an impact on bookbanning and dei instruction]( as our partners at the 19th\* have found. check out a discussion about this very topic in this video [",2
41,"thank you for your answer. i do enjoy your rating system more than a lot of other fact check sites and articles. i still think there's room for improvement. for instance you've only found 8 ""true"" things harris has said? seems like you could find more than that from a single speech. even with harris jumping in late we couldn't get more than 65 compared to over 1,000 for trump. again the take away here for many is that trump told the truth 36 times compared to only 8 for harris. also several of her half truths and lower ratings rely on taking trump's word for on topics he's constantly lied about or flip flopped on. for example, when harris says trump is going to repeal aca, that doesn't seem like a half truth to me. he already tried it once, he's flipped back and forth depending on the crowd about whether he wants to do it again and even when he says he won't, we'd be idiots to actually believe it. seems like a full truth to me. thanks again for your time!",0
20,i think the big issue with your rating on the statement in question is that you're taking trump's claims at face value. he has a verifiable track record of saying one thing and doing another. using his word as source for a claim's validity is just propping up the value of his word and watering down your own.,0
97,he never should have been in the first place. no idea how he even got nominated the first time. there should be a requirement you have to hold at least one public office before being able to even come within a sniff of president. even local city council. trump had literally nothing.,0
39,"from hayes brown, writer and editor for msnbc daily: it isn’t the chance of delay that is the biggest contributor to the [unease that millions of americans have felt]( as election day approaches. it’s that there is any tension about the outcome at all. the 2024 election should not be anywhere near [as close as it appears]( not with trump’s name on the ballot for the third straight election. it is disheartening, to say the least, that this should be where we find ourselves as a country once more, four years after trump was expelled from the white house. it is a state of play that would have seemed unfathomable in the immediate aftermath of trump’s chaotic exit. i have not forgotten the slow, horrifying realization that trump was not going to leave office willingly. i have watched as his various sins and transgressions have been laid bare before the public. and i have watched as he clawed his way back to the center of american politics again, poised to be an even greater threat than before. read more: [",0
8,donald trump should not be. fixed it for ya.,2
5,the shear disrespect this country received from world leaders after trump was elected was disgusting. another trump presidency will cause all the worlds leaders to give up on the citizens of the us because a repeat of trump is the definition of insanity.,0
5,"you ever play a video game and see that the final boss has a crazy, world-ending desperation attack (think >!tempus finis!< in ff7 rebirth)? this is trump’s desperation attack. we keep him out, he gets sentenced and the world breathes a sigh of relief; if he’s in, he’s immune.",1
4,"i've had a thought about the post-trump era should harris win. i doubt the maga extremism would go away even without him. as much as i want him to rot in prison i would offer him a plea deal to de-program his minions and take down his dangerous enablers. if he would admit his lies and misinformation, cooperate with authorities by providing any incriminating evidence of his plots and conspiracies, and not challenge the results of this election i could stomach letting him live his remaining days at mar-a-lago and the golf course. it's completely against his nature to do any of that but if he would do it to stay out of prison maybe some of us could get some family and friends back from the depths.",1
5,"no. he should not. i was speaking with a friend about this the other day. he disagreed with me when i said that it was a complete failure of the current administration to not to hold the seditionists in power accountable in any way. a complete failure appointing a clown of an ag, to appease gop clowns, instead of someone that would asses and take the open threats to democracy seriously. we should not be staring down the barrel of another trump presidency. there have been so many crimes that have been brushed under the rug. not taking them seriously, and doing fuckall about j6, its organizers, backers, and leaders was a colossal failure. at this point in the game, i don’t think any other policy from the biden administration even matters, as our democracy is in danger. i cast a ballot for biden, and against trump. i was expecting *something* to be done…fucking *anything* to hold the people at the top of the shit storm accountable. instead…we got merrick fucking garland, someone endorsed by thr federalist society, whose inaction protected the fuckers, instead of any accountability. i don’t have a choice, as i show up to vote against the gop, and whatever d is on the ticket. i’m really sick of the only other viable party we have talking about “bipartisanship” with fucking traitors and liars. talking about their ‘colleagues across the aisle’ when those fuckers block every functional piece of legislation, deny science, and cater to religious loonies. the democratic party needs to stop worrying about what the gop is going to think. we *know* what their plan is, and what they’re going to do…they never shut up about it. the only people that don’t fucking believe them, and fall for the same dumb shit, is the democratic leadership. for fuck sake…they have fucking manifesto. it is so disappointing we are where we are.",0
16,"not an american but if trump wind it sends a message to the rest if the world that americans are exactly like the leader they elected- dumb, greedy, immoral, impulsive, racist, power hungry, cult following, war monging idiots. it allows the behavior to follow in other countries. the radicals, the extremists in other countries come out from the cracks and try to follow what america has done. donald trump will support worst of the worst people and dictators, supplying them with fund, military grade weapons to cause chaos. trump will use the chaos as the ladder to rise and get richer. he will cause the whole world to go into throws of chaos. pleaseeee make kamala win. please, not just for your sake but for the rest of the world’s as well. no one wants a 3rd world war. it will definitely happen when trump comes to power.",0
3,"those at fault are many - billionaire owners of all media outlets have sanewashed trump for years and created sound bytes for those disillusioned masses that felt forgotten - trump addressed them personally and they felt heard - hasn’t helped that over the years that the education system has been systematically defunded and curriculums watered down, creating a populace without critical thinking capabilities",0
3,"we will see the true numbers in the next couple of days, but my god if it really is just a couple % between the candidates. i cannot believe what despicable, apocalyptic evil the trump camp represent and after all that, the american voting public swings to them just a couple % less. like oh wow all this badness, i guess makes sense that the other candidate leads by like 3% in *some* states. this monster should straight up be unelectable. like full on a tiny fringe of 10% of the public can stomach to vote for him, and the rest goes to the other candidate(s) (yes it's bullshit there isn't a real choice between more than two but that's another story). how is it that the voting public and the media and everything hate democrats *this* much? kamala harris comes across like a decent person. i haven't seen anything of her platform that i wildly disagree with, or that struck me as the worst thing i've read that week. nor did she say anything that i thought was the most disgraceful and stupid thing i've ever heard. donald trump does this every day. what he proposes and says is so utterly incomprehensibly childish and evil and bad, i just can't fathom how anyone thinks that's an ok thing for a grown man to think and say. and past all the rank stupidity is some really incredibly foul malice and perversion and evil, that's why it stopped being funny to me years ago.",0

3,"it is pretty common to wonder how someone who is not a complete idiot can vote for trump. how can they not realize that he is a clown, a scammer, an egocentric person who only cares about himself and is in no way qualified to be president? but we must consider that if he has managed to get 65 to 70 million votes, it is statistically impossible that all of his voters are complete idiots. the reason, which might seem a bit contradictory, is that many of those who vote for him do not actually like him but appreciate that he is capable of annoying the people they hate. they support him as a form of retribution against those who have tried to trample on their beliefs or their own convictions. many of those who vote for trump do so out of impulse or a feeling of anger, wanting to be heard. as the old proverb says: ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend."" perhaps it is time for liberals to start analyzing why their policies are not equally liked by everyone. because evidently, they are the cause of this problem.",0

1,"embarrassment is a strong word, perhaps tomorrow’s result will feed into that one way or another. i’m a brit and have been following us politics since trump was elected, when people start talking about british politics to me i normally reply that i am ootl because i have been following us politics. they normally go wide eyes and say something like “yes me too, isn’t it terrible?”. my biggest fear as a european is the longevity of america’s involvement in nato. who knows how many us politicians are being influenced by foreign sources, including without their knowledge. if trump is elected we are potentially fucked.",2
1,"good news is, after tomorrow, we'll never have the option to vote for or against trump ever again. thanks joe for giving republicans a free pass to continue their coup unopposed by your fbi and justice department for four fucking years.",1
9,"also-propaganda. we’ve seen that billionaires get to create the narratives that americans will lap up. trump should have unified republicans and democrats to say, “while we may disagree, this guy has to go.” but nope, right wing media kept their base on a steady stream of outrage and lies, well here we are.",2
1,"while this is true, you shouldn't need the justice system. it's a democracy. if all that's keeping it from electing trump as president it's the fact he's in prison then you've still got massive problems. you need the democratic party to do its job; convince the american people that he's an unacceptably poor candidate and put forward a credible alternative. that after everything he's said and everything he's done he's still in the conversation is an utterly dismal failure on their part. after this election, win or lose, the democrats need to look at why they've done so badly.",0
79,"even when trump kicks the bucket, we should never forget what the republican party did to america by enabling trump and brushing aside his myriad crimes.",0
1,rhonda santis is the next torchbearer for the trump cult,0
4,"i think the world order held throughout the trump presidency because of the guardrails that were there at the time. all he got done was tax cuts for the rich and banning muslims, kissed putin's ring and cuddled kim jong un - god knows what damage he might have inflicted if he had the project 2025 squad around him back then. but it won't survive another trump presidency. america did an amazing job working with its allies stabilising the world after wwii but unfortunately it may not stay that way.",1
1,i'm from germany but i'm really worried because trump is a true fascist and a madman.,0
4,"as long as republicans are powerful enough to heavily influence the education system, school books won't remotely touch this shit. they will have no choice but to treat trump as if he had been a perfectly ordinary president. there will be no mention of his insanity, no mention of his fascism, no mention of his utter incoherence and incompetence. i'd bet everything i own on this.",0
30,"that's not even mentioning how the justice system handed bush the presidency even though we now know gore won florida. there are systems in the justice system to afford defendants the maximum opportunity to defend themselves. this is exploited by people like trump to get off with basically no punishment for myriad crimes he's committed. however the justice system has also been thoroughly corrupted by conservative partisans by the hand of mitch mcconnell. it was bad 25 years ago and it's even worse now. we have a candidate who's clearly ineligible to be president who has been allowed to run for no reason other than partisan justices sitting on the supreme court. our system of checks and balances on the justice system is ill-equipped to handle the amount of corruption which has crept into the system over the last quarter, if not half, century. another interesting aside is the scale of the media industry is beyond that which our founding fathers could have ever imagined. they could never imagine a charlatan with the celebrity as someone like trump nor the propaganda produced by the likes of fox news.",0
122,as soon as trump won he dismantled those investigations and fired everyone looking into him. the public let this happen tbh with no questions so i would not place the blame on those folks who got fired.,0
20,"like... us minorities are sitting back and thinking ""...first time?"". trump's time in the spotlight has been so hard to digest. trump is the personification of all the bs that can be committed in this country when you're apart of the in-crowd. churches, government, police, and what have you. always perpetrating, but having the ability to look at yourself and say ""i see nothing wrong"" and then going about to do something else. then everyone else shrugging their shoulders and saying ""what are you gonna do?"" while putting the boot harder to the back of your neck because you did the thing that everyone else does, but it's particularly bad that you do it. like smoking weed.",0
1,"obama was expecting bipartisan support to deal with foreign interference, not realising that most of those on the other side were bought and paid for by the russians. hopefully all that kompromat they have on cruz, graham, paul and others will come spilling out soon. i often wonder if things would be different if obama's administration had tried and prosecuted those responsible for the 2008 economic meltdown, rather than let them have billions in public money and bonuses. it seemed to usher in a ""let's do anything we damn well want to"" mentality. a lot of people in this thread are talking about what a harris/walz administration might do, but how about all those so-called moderate/traditional republicans who have let their party be managed by far-right fruitcakes while the voting public demonstrate time and again that trumpism, for the most part, is not a winning strategy. this mis-match has not been addressed.",0
1,biden could have appointed an attorney general and fbi director who would have done a full court press to aggressively prosecute trump and his co-conspirators starting in february 2021. but nope. gotta maintain the illusion of 'political neutrality' at any cost. forget how giving republican seditionists a free pass to break the law without fear of consequence is anything but neutral. thanks joe. you fucked us.,1
1,i just watched an interview of people saying they despise trump but will vote for him anyway because he's republican. they apparently exist.,2
1,"not defending trump, but ""felon"" in that context doesn't accurately portray how dangerous trump really is. felonies are criminal offenses on a federal level, and there's a huge range of offenses all the way from bad to hot sauce straight from satan's dickhole. for example: my brother is a felon because he was homeless in winter season, someone offered to let him sleep in their barn as long as he watered their pot plants, and he was scooped up in a property wide police raid. i was there for the hearing and the federal courtroom had the tallest ceiling i've ever seen in my life. the judge told my brother ""your involvement in this was so minimal... that i do not understand why you need to be here.. but i must follow the law and make an example of you... one of leniency, but also one that deters others.."" so he offered my brother a few months in prison, or a couple years of probation. my point being: just because someone is a felon, does not mean they're as evil and life threatening as trump. my brother watered pot plants. trump incited a full on attack against our nation's capital.",0
140,she also seems to recognize trump as a more serious threat than “he’s got the morals of an alley cat” biden did. she knows that insults from the 1950s aren’t going to stop him.,0
2,"nah, he isn’t a coward. he’s a *moderate.* it is the nature of the moderate to believe that everyone will eventually calm down and things will go back to normal. this leaves them ill suited for dealing with irrational people. garland could not have conceived of the possibility that trump would have a serious chance of retaking the white house in 2024. worse, anyone who might have suggested it to him would have been considered “irrational.”",0
22,"every fbi agent who investigated his campaign and russian ties was forced out, fired, or resigned voluntarily from the fbi. add in all the humiliation, targeting via tweets that trump put them through and i just can't handle another administration of that all over again. especially knowing people who have worked in the federal government as a career - this guy ruined lives just because trump always has to do things in the most corrupt manner possible.",0
3,"> as soon as trump won he dismantled those investigations and fired everyone looking into him. funny how trump was so readily able to interfere with the justice department but the nanosecond you suggest biden is culpable for not firing garland for inaction and replacing him with an acting ag the flaccid, yellow-bellied sjws flood out of the woodwork screeching wedontwantthepresidentdoingthat!!!!! refusing to combat republican criminality in like terms is how they win.",0
5,"i mean, iirc a few straight up admitted they were afraid of trumps supporters if they voted to convict. so both?",0
1,"oh, i'm sure the religious right wing troll scotus would treat president biden's immunity attempts with as much dignity and respect as they did college debt relief. in other words, they'd wipe their asses with it. like i said, republicans are responsible for donald trump.",0
91,i don’t know if biden ever really recognized the seriousness of trump and the modern gop. i think he still sees trump as an outlier and the gop as the same party of the 70’s and 80’s he used to work with in the senate.,0
12,"it's hard to describe trump accurately when even a confusing, toothless insult like ""deplorables"" gets the nyt shrieking that dems are just as bad as republicans.",0
3,"this is how it starts, yknow. russia is an oligarchy, the wealthy do what they want, vanish reported who report on their corruption, and nobody is ever arrested for the murders. trump not being held to account is the first sign that we're teetering on the precipice of our own journalists and media being brought to heel with no legal recourse, because he's going to restructure the entire government to defend him.",0
2,"fun fact! the president can appoint an 'acting' attorney general at any time, without the need for congressional approval. trump did this several times with different positions to get around congress. - [acting appointments help trump avoid saying ‘you’re hired]( - [vacancies, acting officials and the waning role of the u.s. senate]( there is no excuse. and to the inevitable sjws who loudly and wrongly screech thepresidentshouldntdothatitsnothowamericawantsthingstowork!!!! all i can say is, how does letting republicans do anything they want unopposed while still choosing to tie your own hands behind your back and embracing failure as a strategy worked for you so far? i seem to recall neville chamberlain doing that in the 1930s with hitler and that worked awesome! only ten million people died. it wasn't that bad!",0
1,"instead of going into every town hall with their rep or senator, or going on tv on-the-street interviews with cnn/msnbc/fox and saying ""i'm voting because immigration's bad"" or whatever fabricated issue the gop has flooded the political discussion with nonissues so that they could control the narrative, people need to be telling their candidates and representatives that they want justice. i'm happy to see some polls even bother to include ""protecting democracy"" among topics that voters can express as priorities these past few years. instead of discussing actual problems that need solved, we're stuck spending decades rehashing healthcare, abortion, immigration reform, etc. -- all issues that would've been solved 20 years ago or never needed solving if the gop got out of the way. i can't tell you the last time i heard a single soul on mainstream media utter the words ""chevron defense"". that was probably the most significant overturning of precedent since roe v wade, yet it got a tiny fraction of attention. it will likely be the reason that climate change is never addressed by our government, even if harris wins, while trump's judicial appointments tear down decades-old epa policy in court and prevent our government from doing...well, anything. same thing will happen with the fda and drugs and vaccines. fcc and internet access. we could go on all day looking at previously accepted and settled administrative policy that will be tied up in court challenges for decades now. the loss of chevron is the epitome of the gop's messaging that ""government doesn't work, elect us and we'll show you."" its impact will outlive a second trump term, if he even has one. but nobody seems to care.",0
3,"it’s time for the media to quit giving a shit what the 30% dumbest and most gullible americans want or think. seems like they didn’t until about 20 years ago. news used to sound more educated, like npr does today. “but dusty, npr has republicans on their shows and are giving them equal credence!” i’ve listened to npr daily since 2009, it shocked me too at first. then i remembered, the hosts and most of the guest speakers are legitimately intelligent and highly educated, even if their ceo is a republican. intelligent people can use critical thinking and will know better than to believe the pro-trump crap. it’s giving people who mainly listen to them on the radio a front row seat to just how stupid magats really are.",1
23,"i live in florida and i see at least five trump ads to harris' one. fox news plays loudly in every hospital, dr office and any waiting room with a tv.",2
4,no - you make a perpetual 'acting' appointment like trump did several times. biden just caving to republicans and appointing their guy is just embracing failure as a strategy. and doing so after trump made so many perpetual acting appointments to get around congress was just fucking stupid. its why old-school democrats like biden all need to go.,0
27,it helped that even his own party was outraged - the complicity of mcconnell & co. is what saved trump from *three* impeachments.,2

23,"one of the most impactful experiences of my life was working and traveling abroad for 10 years and during the 1990’s. i learned so much about democracy and the usa by living outside. it changed my life and love of country forever. most of what we are seeing the past 10 years with trump in our lives and faces in such a prolific way is the lower end of the normal bell shaped curve of human intelligence (reasoning, memory, processing) becoming louder and more confident that they are finally heard or understood. i believe if every american voted it would overwhelmingly reflect moderate liberalism and a love of democracy. but people are exhausted from the cacophony of toxicity. those with money can escape it in all kinds of ways. the rest of us have had to endure. i’m an intelligent, hard working person and give and give and give. i’ve voted for 6 presidents in my lifetime starting with walter mondale in ‘84 when i was 19, but the emotional fatigue from uninformed, toxic persons almost makes me want to give up and become a hermit.",0

-1,i don’t know why you’re getting worked up and trying explain reason with maga rhetoric. in their eyes it’s the democrats fault this country is a mess because democrats have held the office of president for 12 of the past 16 years. this is a reason they claim that trump is the only choice.,0

1,"i didn't call it rape. i'm claiming it's indicative of a pattern of behavior. and also, no. for one, there's something called a mens rea, or criminal mental state. a trans person wanting to use a same-gendered same-age space isn't the same thing as an adult trying to ogle a minor. an adult woman accessing a minors' changing area to ogle minors, especially with no reasonable cause to be there and with no expectation on the part of the minors that they will be there, is also disgusting and abusive. but very cool of you to disparage an oppressed minority. and very cool of you to defend the actions of someone walking in on minors changing. ""it's not rape though, is it?"" neat, dude. ""if trump did anything at epstein island that information would have definitely been released in the last three and a half years""? just like everything we found out about all of the people who went to epstein island, right? the very author who gave us the epstein audio tapes said epstein showed him pictures of trump with topless minors. not sure what bill clinton has to do with this, but you won't see me defending him.",0
1,bill clinton flew to the island on multiple occasions. there is ffa records of that and they have been released to the public. there is no record of trump ever visiting the island. so you are okay with drag queens teaching kindergarteners about sex? not to mention hilary covering up and threatening women that was claiming bill raped them.,0

15,"2 things: first, as a general rule, i don't take polls as gospel. poling on the day of the brexit referendum said remain would win, they didn't. every single poll for the 2016 election said hillary would win, she didn't. the polls for the french elections earlier this year said the far right action francais party would win a landslide, they came third overall. not two weeks ago, polls said the moldovan referendum on a new, pro eu constitution would win comfortably, it won by .35% and second, in order to win, trump is going to have to somehow get more votes than he did last time, before he refused to concede, before jan 6, before he was impeached twice, before the party's hard and blatant lurch to the far right, before roe v wade was shot dead, before he was convicted of 34 felonies, before he quite clearly started losing his mind. i simply cannot believe he has gained many supporters since then, to the contrary he's seemingly losing them hand over fist, both because they don't like what they're seeing and, well, a lot of people die in a 4 year span. and there simply doesn't seem to be any enthusiasm behind him anymore from people who aren't completely nuts, to win, he's going to have to get more than 75 million votes and honestly, i think it'd be far more likely for him to get around 60-55, if not less. so yeah, i'm pretty confident harris will win because i simply cannot see how he wins otherwise.",1

""they will not stop at the workplace, they will not stop at the border—they will take every inch we give them,"" said the president of the uaw, which has endorsed democratic nominee kamala harris. ""we don't engage in political activity because we like a candidate. we don't do it for ourselves, as your union leadership. we don't do it for the democratic or republican parties. we engage in politics as a union because it is core to our fight for economic and social justice."" fain said that the united states is currently trapped in a ""vicious cycle"" in which the ""ruling class has waged a one-sided class war on the working class, and they've been winning."" ""we're in a vicious cycle where the billionaire and corporate class take more and more for themselves and rewrite the rules of the game to keep it that way,"" said fain. ""they use their insane wealth to buy off politicians and elections. the lap dogs of the billionaires then pass more laws that restrict unions and keep working-class people down. they consolidate the fruits of our labor into the hands of wall street and corporate america, and that cycle goes on and on."" ""it is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections. but it's also a devastating situation for the working class."" fain acknowledged that ""it's a bipartisan issue"" and that billionaires have ""done everything they can to buy off both parties,"" characterizing the gop as the outspoken party of big business and condemning ""corporate democrats"" who ""have also cozied up to the rich."" **""it is an embarrassment to our democracy when billionaires can openly buy elections,"" said fain.

29,"i think the question isn't in terms of ""equal"" coverage, but more how you're portraying all sides. for example, harris may speak for an hour with detail on policy on multiple issues but trump can just repeat the word tariffs and sway to music for an hour straight, and the media doesn't really portray the events accurately. the media just reports that harris/trump offered conflicting views of policy approach, with trump reiterating his commitment to tariffs (or something else that sounds sanewashed). it seems like the media is more concerned with appearing to be fair to all sides than it is to report accurately. with trying to be fair, you're putting trump on an equal playing field with harris, when we can see his grasp of concepts like ""drill baby drill"" and tariffs shows he really has no understanding or ability to develop sound policy. that's my issue with the msm with trying to be fair, that they've neglected the impartiality.",0
6,"> the intention is to deport those who have entered the country illegally with a criminal record as soon as possible. that is not what he says trump recently again pointed to what eisenhower did - ""operation weback"". that has nothing to do with criminal records (and also realize, by definition, illegals will have 'criminal records' by being in the us illegally. for this conversation i will assume you are talking about actual criminal records). it has to do with catching whatever illegals, putting them on ships and planes, and 'returning them'. it lasted one year under eisenhower, returned one million people including mistakenly rounding up american citizens. jd vance has re-enforced this by telling the nyt recently he thinks it is 'reasonable' to deport around a million a year. (which was of course far different then what he said in 2012). and they are not just referring to illegal immigrants. remember springfield ohio ? those haitians are not here illegally, they are here under temporary protected status - they are paying tax dollars. trump would thrown all of those people out too.",0

6,"so is trump just bad at judging the quality of people when he chooses them to work for him? or is he saying he's such a weak, ineffectual leader that he couldn't bring people he assigned to understand the merits of his agenda? or is this more trump excuses where nothing is his fault, everything he does is perfect, and it's just the entire world out to get him. probably the last one because that really resonates with the conservative base.",0

[us: supreme court rules that disqualifying individual under 14th amendment is for congress in trump ‘insurrection’ case]( >in september 2023, six republican and unaffiliated colorado voters filed a lawsuit in state court alleging trump had disqualified himself from holding future public office. **the plaintiffs argued that trump had overseen a broad-based effort to unlawfully overturn the 2020 election results** and that he incited a violent mob to attack the us capitol on 6 january in a bid to stop the lawful transfer of power to biden. >**a colorado state court found that trump had indeed engaged ‘insurrection’** but ruled through somewhat technical legal reasoning that the president is not an ‘officer’ of the us within the meaning of the 14th amendment. the disqualification clause therefore didn’t apply. >the plaintiffs appealed and the colorado supreme court ruled in december that the president is an ‘officer’ of the us, reversing the lower court’s constitutional ruling while **upholding the finding of fact on ‘insurrection’ and concluding trump should be barred from the ballot.** >but in oral arguments before the us supreme court, the discussion shifted. **‘the overarching concern […] appears to be this disenfranchisement issue: what happens if we allow this to go forward and we have inconsistent results among the states,’** prather says. ‘the most persuasive part of that argument was the fact that the enforcement act of 1870 gave the department of justice the power to bring lawsuits to disqualify federal officials. and so, why would we further give that ability to states to do on a case-by-case basis.’ >in a 13-page per curiam opinion, the justices reasoned that **allowing states to enforce section 3 for federal candidates would create a ‘patchwork’ in which trump could be barred in some states but not others.** ‘instead, it is congress that has long given effect to section 3 with respect to would-be or existing federal officeholders,’ the supreme court ruled. however, congress probably won’t take such action in respect of trump given its current composition. >the court didn’t rule on the underlying question of whether trump had committed insurrection as his lawyers had requested. >noah bookbinder, president of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, dc, a watchdog group that helped bring the colorado case, was quick to note that **the court had not exonerated trump. ‘every court – or decision-making body – that has substantively examined the issue has determined that january 6th was an insurrection and that donald trump incited it,’** bookbinder says. trump, for his part, has denied he is an insurrectionist. this appears to have not been right case for the courts to determine if trump is ineligible for office because of his insurrection/coup attempt, as it deals with candidates appearing on state ballots instead of trump's illegal actions. but really, trump committed an insurrection attempt, and should be ineligible to hold office. here's more information on [federal prosecution of donald trump (election obstruction case)]( and here's more information on trump's [attempts to overturn the 2020 united states presidential election](",0

20,"i can promise you that if the candidates were flipped, i would vote republican. we’ve had some pretty awful presidential candidates in the past and when both candidates are equally awful people follow party lines strictly. when one candidate has much better policy for the future of the usa and is a much much much much much much better human being in general, party ties shouldn’t matter nearly as much. but, you are probably correct, people will do whatever mental gymnastics they need to do to keep the party line. as a thought experiment let’s flip either side of that around. harris is now the candidate that is a felon, has been found liable of rape, and tried to overthrow the peaceful transfer of power with violence, bragged about sneaking in to see underage girls naked at a beauty pageant, was best friends with jeffery epstein etc. but she also has some great policies that would increase taxes on the rich and help lower middle class taxes, help first time homebuyers, fights for woman’s rights, and supports ukraine etc. who do you vote for? and now switching the other way, harris is herself, a decently good person that has a track record in politics, but her policies are awful tariffs, a nationwide ban on abortion, and “concepts of a plan” of healthcare. well, this election cycle, this isn’t the case. you have to be an extremely committed, “i will never ever ever vote across the aisle” person to pinch your nose and walk into a voting booth and vote for trump. if this election is even close, we are screwed. look at how a single person can manipulate half the population while pushing a vision of “loyalty or bust” through every seat in the republican party. if someone this unintelligent and unqualified can pull this off, imagine if someone that had half a brain and a little charisma got in there. i’m still moderately young (36) but i had no idea human beings were so flawed until i saw the covid pandemic happen. there are a lot of factors ranging from the way our minds developed through evolution and how we cling to false ideas to feel more safe and comfortable, to the way the media abuses its power of misinformation to get more viewers. either way, we’re screwed. idiocracy and don’t look up seem like probable outcomes now.",0
2,"i think you're somewhat wrong here. i agree that party line voting is institutional, but i believe trump got elected because he brought out people who did not vote before. the magats never saw something in a candidate they could believe in prior to him. they want to disrupt the system because they genuinely do not believe the system is there to support them. this minority is the proud people who need public services but won't use them, vote against policies that they themselves have used or depend on, and hate others because those 'others' get heard more than they do - they're oppressed. trump is a rallying cry against everything that minimalizes them, telling them both that their vote would be heard and that those against would concoct devious strategies to mislead them. this is why we get the empty gees and the boeberts now spewing conspiracy theories with wild abandon - because it convinces them that actual facts coming from the other side are just meant to oppress them. the only reason trump ran as a republican is because obama roasted him. it's likely the only reason he ran at all is because he was handed the truth social grift, and russia thought he could destabilize our government. i'm pretty sure he would have run on any platform and found a sizeable minority to support him. after all, it's much easier to vote against what doesn't match your values than what does. hopefully most people recognize the value of voting for democracy and against the orange dictatorship.",1

(which makes no sense and isn't how any of that works). the relevant republican senators just explicitly broke their oath and didn't do their job, specifically so that he would be eligible to run again as a selfish power play. that's why he's eligible. not because he has any scrap of innocence. -------------- anyway, the reason why /r/politics is more liberal than many other politics subreddits, is because it allows people to debate without any moderation based on mere position or facts. only on being civil, etc. the conservative heavy subreddits only remain that way by literally just banning people who give to many ""liberal talking points"". because they simply don't have reality and the facts on their side, and they don't know what to say when people flood them with citations and fact checks and debunkings for their nonsense. so they have to just ban them to keep up the party line. when you have a subreddit that allows fact checking and is popular enough to have eyeballs on it, republican rhetoric cannot survive well at all.",0

12,"what scares me are the people in power who know about this. on top of that, trump knowingly mishandled highly classified documents. gop leadership is just standing back letting this major security risk run for president instead of denouncing him",0

3,"maybe? i get the impression that trump's corruption is mostly done out in the open. even when we don't have rock solid proof, there is tons of circumstantial evidence. so maybe nothing truly new will come to light. for example when kushner got a $2bn saudi investment, after being middle eastern envoy. we don't have hard evidence, but everybody ""knows"" that those billions were kickback for some kind of corrupt service.",0

191,anyone have the video of just the trump super cut?,2
248,"**more of this. seriously.** i literally wrote this just before seeing footage of this earlier today: isn't it a missed opportunity here to broadcast at every single one of the harris rallies a montage of trump's scandals and blunders? insulting gold star families; the shoving of arlington cemetery staff; the thumbs-up beside grave-members of servicemembers who committed suicide, saying he likes war heroes who weren't captured. i mean have very long lists like this and a campaign apparatus should easily be able to compile this and just run it for a segment of every rally, post it on every one of their social media platforms, and incorporate into their ads. [the daily show does this so well, like klepper's segment last week (particularly beginning at 4:55).]( it could be satirical like, ""ahh, remember the good old days...? when trump said he wished charged child sex trafficker ghislaine maxwell, epstein's partner well?"" poll after poll is showing that people are waxing poetic about trump's administration more so than when they lived under it. it seems the harris campaign could do better to remind them of the laundry-list of chaos that this was and that we don't need to live through this again. i feel her closing positions need to be: - the economy is improving by every indicator, faster than any other country post-pandemic; let's continue the trend. let's stay the course. - since last year a republican-made and border patrol-endorsed security bill was blocked because of trump. ""he couldn't even defend the capitol from insurrectionists. he couldn't even finish the wall in 4 years and of course never made mexico pay for it. all he did was let steve bannon defraud supporters, who trump then pardoned."" - trump is very old. that's a liability. - abortion and women's rights is on the ballot.",0

5,"i hope people realize that one thing that’s really scary is that trump literally wants to cancel the first amendment. he wants to make it a punishable crime to go against what he says. these are the actions of a dictator obsessed with enriching himself, not someone who cares about their country or its people.",0

6,she should keep doing it. every rally. cause trump has too many friends in msm and the won't do it.,0
7,problem is they won't and the other problem you have is that the media do a shit job of reporting on trump in general. the problem america faces is that in an age of ratings and money the media may have doomed us to an america that is about to come crashing down. it shouldn't be a close race and trump shouldn't be on the ticket but poor media coverage and external interest groups have ensured that he is. we all could be in a lot of trouble.,2

5,she should also show the donald trump dance party.,0
4,everyone needs to also hear jd vance’s words he is just as scary and guaranteed a time as president should trump win. i see no way that trump will make it four years without showing significant dementia to the point he will be forced to step down. jd vance is truly a light weight and will not ever be ready to take on the duties of the presidency,0
2,"of course kamala is 100% correct. the bottom line is the people that need to comprehend this may not be possess the common sense necessary to piece all of this together. they may not have the time to do anything except to skim over the facts or be willing to challenge their friends and family that are going to vote for trump. this will lead us into a government that will strip us of rights and freedom to speak. it will also change reduce dramatically the education, welfare, social security and health care system for those that have no means to provide for their family. the lack of common sense is even more vivid when the history of this man makes it ok to cheat on taxes, steal from those that have done work for him, steal from the government, commit treason and has been convicted for rape. i don't know how you reach those that refuse to do what is right when they enter the voting booth. if they vote for the cretin and he wins then they need to keep their mouth shut when they are stripped of what they have been benefiting from .",2

3,"[ tl;dr, it's basically a list of the dangerously dumb things trump has claimed recently. calling illegal immigrants ""animals"" who will ""walk into your kitchen"" and ""cut your throat."" claiming that he'll somehow erase the national debt while also promising tax breaks and new expenditures. claiming that the ocean will only rise an eighth of an inch over the next 500 years (when really it's projected to rise several inches in just a few decades). calling harris a mentally impaired radical marxist. saying of immigrants, ""we allowed them to come in and raid and rape our country."" saying that immigrants are murderers and that it's ""in their genes... we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now."" claiming federal aid is being withheld from disaster-struck republican areas and that harris spent all the fema money on housing for illegal immigrants (of course, trump himself once considered withholding aid from blue areas when he was president).",0

34,"i think the counter-factual of trump winning is something we should really consider. he would have handled inflation so much worse.. pressured the fed to move more aggressively and recklessly, he wouldn’t have invested like biden did which averted a recession and gave us a soft landing. i highly doubt the vaccine rollout would have been as good because he would have found more way to politicize it and make it worse. he may have already given israel carte blanche to fully level gaza. he would have let russia have ukraine already. the list of horrible goes on and on!",1

0,"and yet your opinion of them only reinforces their mindset. maybe it's more complicated than you think. it's easy for you if they're all braindead hicks. but what if they have come to the conclusion that trump and kamala are more similar than dissimilar when it comes down to what affects their daily lives? trump does come across as more honest to a lot of people because he says whatever stupid shit is on his mind. he's not concerned with political speak, and speaking out both sides of his mouth. people like trump because he seems like you get what you get. i see that and think ""oh fuck, this psycho is going to ruin our lives for a generation"" but that's not what other people see. they might be misinformed, they might be bigoted, they might be poor people who have never really felt seen (regardless of the fact that the man with the gold toilet is saying he's their ally). but it's too simplistic to say these people are deplorable in every way. i would hope you wouldn't shame someone who couldn't read as being worthless. some people are in such a rat race fighting to survive that they've lost empathy. some people are just uneducated through little to no fault of their own. instead of writing off such a huge part of america, maybe think about how dismissing them as bigots and racists (of which there are plenty) might make them even more likely to support candidates like trump. you can't be shocked when you call a group of people assholes constantly and then they vote for an asshole. it becomes meaningless to them.",0

97,he’d be building a trump hotel there by now,0
38,"part of the reason we had so much inflation at all is that trump pressured the fed to keep interest rates low and overheat the economy because he wanted to run on a strong economy in 2020. this is also why he flipped the fuck out over the covid lockdowns causing an economic slowdown, and wanted to push for everything to reopen asap. and of course right-wing media followed right along, which more or less got people killed, all because he wanted a strong economy so he could run for reelection on it.",0

37,"this is the answer. i know a former democrat who fucking hates trump but is going to ""hold his nose"" and vote for him anyway. not because of trump or his cronies or their policies, but because the right-wing media he's recently started watching has successfully convinced him that the alternative is unthinkable. communism, anarchy, the destruction of the constitution, mass importation of terrorists, enforced transgender stuff, and a huge amount of other batshit lunacy. people are wasting their time trying to convince others of the unsuitability of trump as a candidate, because that isn't the issue.",0

1,trying to make sense as to why trump and his cronies continue to tell all these reckless irresponsible outrageous lies in a time of such crisis and there is only one answer- trump not only believes - he knows- his gullible stupid ignorant supporters believe it all and that is all he needs to know. nothing else.,0

2,don’t get me wrong they still are wearing magic underwear but when major leaders are on the front page of the salt lake tribune saying they have a message from god to not vote trump that moves the needle. trump has been critical of this religion and probably part of why he lost az was the lds homemaker wasn’t voting for him. likely skipped that box and went on down the line.,0
1,where did i indicate anything about how you felt about her? my comment was that romney not endorsing her does not equate to choosing party over country. his refusal to endorse her does not mean he is endorsing (or even voting for) trump. not everything is binary.,2

6,"this quote sums it up. “today, america stands at such a moment. a vengeful and emotionally unstable former president—a convicted felon, an insurrectionist, an admirer of foreign dictators, a racist and a misogynist—desires to return to office as an autocrat. trump has left no doubt about his intentions; he practically shouts them every chance he gets. his deepest motives are to salve his ego, punish his enemies, and place himself above the law. should he regain the oval office, he may well bring with him the experience and the means to complete the authoritarian project that he began in his first term.”",1

2,"george washington’s vision for the presidency died when we moved to a party system. george washington actively and openly despised the party system and predicted this of the party system “however [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.” in his 1776 farewell address. this article probably has george rolling in the grave hardcore, he hated the political parties because it has allowed the federal government to be controlled by anybody but the people, mostly lobbyists. and because of his dislike of all political parties and seeming like a man that holds true to his values i believe that he still would dislike political parties and would want to do away with the two party system and bring back independent candidates. in my opinion, if you want real change, vote for people in touch with the reality of living in america right now. i’m sorry but both kamala and trump will never understand what it’s like to go to the grocery store and see your cart fill up with less and less as time goes on. vote for anything other than republican or democrat and we might finally see some progress in the usa. links:",1

1,"i don't get this reaction. the guy himself publicly praises putin. it’s pretty well known that he looks up to the guy. he talks about his phone calls with putin all the time. he brags about putin praising him. he’s basically admitted to just about everything short of being putin’s friend (and he probably had done that too). none of this is new information. when the headlines started coming out today, i just kind of shrugged my shoulders since it’s not really anything new. we all know this won’t tip the scales in any way at all. his supporters even parade around in their “better russian than democrat” shirts. so why is trump upset by this news? it’s a big nothingburger.",0
196,"i liked the part about ""successfully suing"" woodward. yet we haven't heard anything about a lawsuit. trump doesn't want that suit as he doesn't want the evidence on record, like many other times he's not brought suit. he just takes it to the court of public opinion and lies over and over till his base takes it as truth.",0
21,at this point i’m convinced trump is back to writing under pseudonyms “steven cheung” may be a real person but the donald is definitely writing these releases,2

3,"definitely, fox news never reported on the disappearance of the crossfire hurricane intelligence binder which someone stole from the white house at the end of the trump administration. this was reported on back in december of last year by other media outlets. supposedly the senate intelligence committee was briefed on the disappearance of the binder. then suddenly all media goes quiet on it, probably because the pentagon doesn't want anyone talking about it for national security reasons. i'm willing to bet that the contents of that binder are in putin's hands. this is just one more reason trump has to win the election to keep himself out of jail. \*\* i think there is a fair chance that my above comment will disappear. \*\*",0

17,ha! you think trump pays any bill or legal fee,2
2,some are dumb. some are naive. some are actually affraid of facts because they show them how little they know. some think that by denying reality they are sticking it to that teacher in 3rd grade that gave them their first of many fs. some are white supremacists that don't care about anything beyond that point. some are people who have raped and feel like it must not be so bad if their president did it. some believe that critical thinking or anything even close to it is the path to satan. many are a mix of some of these. then there are the ones who don't believe any of trumps shit but think they can better their standing somehow by following him. and of course the ones who get paid russia bux for pushing the bullshit.,1

6,"i have to grudgingly admit, they knew where to hit us. the rancid racism, hatred and gullibility around conspiracy theories so deeply rooted in the american right and the republican party may well have been our achilles’ heel as a country. who would have ever believed that nearly half the country would become suckers for a piece of human garbage like trump? even elon musk is onboard with it. hell, he’s even having a blast while doing so. sick.",0

2,"donald trump has a reasonable chance of winning the election because: 1. base: he's running as a republican, and party bases are centered around issues and not who's in charge. the vast majority of people vote with the bases that political organize them, be it unions, religious groups, prolife/prochoice groups, community groups etc. and these people largely vote their interests and almost never vote against the group itself. they will either vote with the group/issue or abstain - (which is why gotv is so important, the more of these voters you have the less of the non-base swing/undecided voters you need) 2. outsider: like-it-or-not donald trump still represents an outsider. the reason people vote for outsiders, is because they lose faith in institutions. the reason they lose faith in institutions is because they are troubled by the direction those institutions take. an example is of ""poor people"". poor people in this country are marginalized, the minimum wage hasn't risen in forever, qol hasn't really improved, col has gone way up. every single democrat they've seen has promised that they'd be able to make change happen, and every single one has failed. eventually, should enough failures occur, you either look to blame someone, or you look to an alternative (or both). a good portion of people lost faith in us institutions of democracy, justice, governance, law, finances. to them when donald trump said - ""these people are all corrupt"", he was simply restating what people believed themselves. if you start with a belief that institutions are corrupt, then you see those same institutions persecuting a candidate who's won your vote because he's told you those institutions are corrupt, you are very likely to disregard criticism of said candidate as hyperbole, or a plot or whatever. and really, and i say this from someone who's worked to promote and better these institutions for most of my career, it's not exactly peoples fault they have lost trust with the institutions we have given that we've had those same institutions fabricate reasons for wars, financially engineer crises, undermine privacy and freedom, and empower the ever widen gap between the rich and poor. if you lie and lie and lie and lie to people for their own good, you shouldn't exactly be surprised when you are supplanted by a better liar.",0

9,"this is correct, but also the electoral college benefits the minority party. we were not originally meant to only have two political parties. other countries often times have more. with the electoral college, if this were the popular vote, trump would definitely lose because the most populated states and cities are vastly democratic. the less populated states in the country which often times have open spaces have a much larger representation than they should tend to be republican. when the electoral college was created it was meant to give each state an even representation. but some states split to win themselves more votes. like how north and south dakota both claimed to be different enough that they should become two states. ￼ so, even outside of being related to trump himself, the republicans only have to hold as many states as they can as republican. it’s easier to win over states if you have less people to win over, and they largely control the media. for example, if california is always blue/democratic, it has a gdp bigger than many counties. they have a huge population too so it’s unlikely to flip republican. most cities that are hugely populated are blue which sway the state. despite all that, california has as much sway on this matter as rhode island our smallest state. realistically the republican party represents about 35%, but they have for decades clawed their way to strategically win counties in the state level to flip states red. if popular votes mattered, trump would have about 30% of the votes (or less nice he’s pissed off a lot of republicans) which should lose him the election in a landslide.",2

1,not surprising considering how hard trump pushed against mail-in voting. turns out that was a pretty stupid strategy,0
1,"this is interesting. so there are more people voting on election day. it went up from 28% to 45%. that means the election day vote will be bluer. democrats already have a 500,000 ballot advantage in pennsylvania, which is well on its way to the 1.1 million last time, which was good enough to erase republicans' 600,000 vote election day lead. given the early vote proportion has dropped substantially, we should expect a raw vote advantage of 840,000 to have the same effect (assuming trump wins the same proportion of election day votes, which would be a poor assumption given that the election day pool is going to become more democratic with so many 2020 early voters now deciding to vote on election day). mail-in voting only started this week, and they're more than halfway to having the same early vote cushion as they had last time. so what that could look like on election night is that trump will jump out to a lead when election day vote is counted. but it'll be smaller than in 2020 given more democrats are voting on election day. as the days go on, there's still an appreciable amount of very blue friendly votes, like 2020, which moves pa blue fairly quickly. or at least as quickly as they can count. networks may be able to project it based on the outstanding votes relative to trump's lead, and how strongly blue they are. of course, which way third party/independent mail-in voters go can play a big role here. they're about 12% of the mail-in vote. assuming they don't behave much differently than 2020, there's no reason to believe this'll make a huge difference. but if they break hard for whatever reason to either candidate, it could make a difference.",0

9,well trump and republicans have now spent 4 years trashing early and mail in voting...so no wonder.,0
142,"depends on the state. here in ohio, mail ballots begin getting counted as soon as the polls open on election day. that's why in 2020 biden held a lead when results began to be announced. as the night wore on and in person votes were tabulated, biden's lead vaporized and trump wound up winning the state. other states, such as pennsylvania don't even begin opening the mail ballots until the polls close.",2

10,"and the cry for states’ rights on all issues, yet refusing to accept that states control elections, even federal elections, and further, election rules are not uniform across the 50 states. in many states mail in ballots cannot be counted until election day- but, but counting after the polls close is unfair, say all the trumpsters. live by states’ rights, die by states’ rights.",2
6,"because white men are still the biggest voting block, will vote largely for trump and will vote on the day because trump told them mail in ballots were bad",0
0,"because thanks to the electoral college, only certain states matter. pa is 80% white. mi is 78%, wi is 85%, az is 74% nc is 68% ga is 57%. even with white women, something like 45-50% are polling in favor of trump. ultimately the other voting blocks don't matter (with the possible exception of ga) since the white vote is so damn big, whichever way they break, likely decides the state.",0
13,"trump isn't even the president, he doesn't have the doj under his control, nor the attorney general. how will he be able to ""order"" the courts to stop counting at 11pm?",1
5,obama? leads trump by like 3x still on attempts,2
3,"> i think many kamala voters, like myself, don’t want to risk any election day shenanigans. i mean, i wouldn't be surprised if the reds dust off the old playbook and repeat the same lies. when trump is marginally ahead on the day because those votes are counted first, before the blue wave of mail-in or early votes, he's probably gonna cry fraud again.",0
9,same idiots who think trump is going to win new york. they live on an entirely different universe where trump is destined to win all 50 states.,0

10,"nothing, just like last time. in fact, anyone can call an election, doesn’t make it official. that’s why news outlets will say “we project” a certain result. that’s based on their own work though. most of these time projections from reliable media sources are accurate enough that campaigns will accept them. but officially there’s a whole process that takes time and after that’s done, then we have the actual result. i hope i’m wrong, but if trump loses the strategy will be to declare himself the winner, declare the election results fraudulent, and maga influencers will start flooding maga world with baseless conspiracies to justify trump. i’d rather not imagine how maga will respond when their truth becomes that trump is the legitimate winner because we got a taste of that last go-around.",1
12,that works too. trump also doesn't like libraries.,0
1,"i likely will still early vote based on some research i did yesterday, but i'm not trusting mail in voting at all. trump filed like 15 lawsuits in 2020 to get them removed and has now worked for 4 years to install trump friendly folks on election boards.",1

2,"i understand and get your worry. trump lost all those suits, and even though the election board implementation is a concern, i highly recommend reading on what goes into certification and how difficult it would be to actually not certify election votes and/or change votes to favor one candidate over the other. there are checks on checks on checks that occur through multiple people before a cert happens. i’ve volunteered/worked during elections in 2020 and 2022. i’ll also throw in some extreme personal anecdote: when you have so many people come through to vote, there is a certain pride that took over me to make sure their vote counted correctly. for trump “loyalists”, i’d wager some, if not most, will think twice to delegitimize their neighbors/friends/families vote when its nut cuttin time. just a theory though",0
1,"oh no thanks babe i'm not readjudicating 2020 ""election fraud"" by a bunch of twitter threads. trump's team had their day in court - multiple times, and for whatever reason weren't willing to make the same claims under oath that they did publicly",0
1,"that statistic might not necessarily be true anymore. high propensity voters used to be republican, which is why they excelled in midterms. however, those same voters are trending democratic which is one of the reasons why the 2022 midterms weren't a complete blowout. however, the low-propensity voters tend to be more trump-leaning, and rather than try to expand his net, his campaign is focused on trying to bring as many of them to the polls as possible.",0
1,"the biggest concern is, the higher it goes, the likelier it gets compromised. i could 100% see this supreme court saying"" too much ambiguity, send it to the house"" and then trump is a shoe in based on state by state voting, which weighs pretend lines on a map more than actual people.",2
1,"early votes sure, but many many states do not count mail in until election day, and some late in election day. this is literally the point of trump support fake narrative of the late night ""spike"" in dem votes. it was he mail ins. those lawsuits were tossed in 2020 but i have zero faith this year.",0

4,"just imagine it. trump in prison, meaning we no longer have to hear about him every day or listen to his whiny complaints about how unfair everything is or see his puckered asshole of a mouth. even if you don't care for kamala, you should vote for her because her winning means he gets locked up for the rest of his life. we can get rid of him permanently. feels good, man.",0

14,"this is part of the reason why i believe beating trump *this* cycle actually will help begin the recovery against the maga disease. with multiple election losses by trump, and losing the pop vote of the election he did win, plus all the maga losses in other elections throughout the country, maga will be a losing ticket going forward post-2024. however, the republicans don't have much of anybody that could take trump's mantle as an immediate replacement. there are candidates like haley or desantis, sure, but none of them have the pull and appeal that trump does. it could be another cycle or 2 after 2024 before republicans have a viable candidate in a post-trump climate. that should theoretically give democrats a good chunk of time to continue cleaning up the mess from trump, and re-establishing norms, rights, protections, and governmental guardrails, to prevent something like this from happening again. *will it* happen? idk. but i do personally have a feeling that what we've dealt with the last 10ish years is the dying last gasps of desperation from a party and ideology that if they don't get their vision done now, it's not gonna happen. that doesn't mean i believe the ideology behind maga and p2025 will just magically disappear and cease to exist. it will always linger in some capacity. however, if we can win this election, i don't know that it will be the existential threat that it poses presently.",0

9,trump getting assassinated would i think be bad for the democratic party. better to beat him at the ballot box and then send him to prison.,0
2,"it's not entirely clear as this is unprecedented territory. the prevailing theory is that yes he does as he's still a former president. now the question becomes how would that work logistically? most likely it would go one of two ways: option 1: a private wing in a high security facility (like adx florence) where he is guarded primarily by secret service in conjunction with the standard staff. extensive vetting of everyone tasked with guarding him and extreme limiting of his contact with other inmates (possibly even fully blocking it). option 2: essentially on highly restricted house arrest. confined to one of his estates that becomes highly secured and no longer open to the public/ members of the club. extremely monitored and restricted access to the internet (if not outright barred from it) but otherwise allowed free reign of the place. most people agree option 1 would be the preferable one, as trump absolutely belongs locked up behind bars, but the argument can (and likely will when it comes to it) be made that this option is too complicated logistically and too cost-prohibitive so the proposed solution will end up looking something like option 2.",2

15,"since you don’t link the article i have no idea what it might say. i can speculate that it will say something about classified documents being mixed in with the other voluminous records collected after a presidency. that is not the issue. the issue is the lack of cooperation with the national archives staff, the improper storage, and the refusal to return classified material after it had been identified as being in trump’s possession.",2

3,"i believe this is a stunt to walk the line of maintaining support for both. if she says this publicly, it decries attacking taylor swift, but she says she was ""shaken,"" and that she is ""questioning"" her belief in donald trump, it is very non-committal. it also leaves her the option of being back on board whenever something happens that she can use as media justification. so it's a publicity stunt, i feel.",0
3,she never thought trump would go after the whites,1

3,how can a person “suddenly realize” today that trump may not be a good person? this is like “suddenly realizing” that alaska is cold in december.,2
3,"she's still ""questioning""? how firm is trump's grip on people's minds??",0
3,this is so bogus… she just realized that trump doesnt give a fuck. his ship is sinking and shed end up nothing more than a wag with no friends after nov. taylor should boycott her existence.,0

79,trump in the very least has been an asshole his entire adult life.,2
46,well you see taylor swift if very important to her because she was always patrick mahomes annoying asshole wife until tay tay joined her box seat and she became taylor swifts best friend. if she didn't push back when trump attacked taylor then she's liable to get cut off from that saving grace. can't throw drinks on opposing fans heads from your box if taylor swift is in your box.,0
46,"my thoughts exactly. like i get that taylor swift, travis kelce, and patrick mahomes all have platforms because they are some of the best at what they do, but brittany mahomes isn't a world class anything. she doesn't have a platform. nobody is a brittany mahomes fan (except for trump, i guess?). it's hard to imagine anyone thinking ""wow, brittany mahomes supports xyz?"" and having their own opinion changed one iota.",1
9,this is what people should have been saying about trump since the 80s.,2

3,if you have to hide your support for someone... maybe you should reevaluate your support for that person. i suppose that requires some self-reflection which just isn't in the realm of possibility for a trumpster.,0
138,taylor is gonna probably distance herself from brittany to avoid bad pr from hanging out with a trumper.,0

46,"some people only see a problem when it affects them directly. many, many conservatives only realize that gay people aren’t evil when a family member comes out. if trump saying mean things about her bestie opens the door a little so she can hear him say mean things about everyone else, so be it.",0

6,it’s really as simple as we’re rich and want trumps tax policy for the rich.,0
4,a majority of white women voters voted for trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. one reason why is that growing up in a racist community and being exposed to a steady stream of racist propaganda in right wing media will convince a white woman that only a white strongman leader can protect her from being raped/murdered by black/brown men.,0
34,"what's cray is that some of these people who are for trump are minorities. how can you be black, gay, hispanic, have some type of disability, especially one that effects your life to some negative extent, or whatever is against the gop interest and be all for this dude and the gop? some of it, i can see how it happens, grew up that way and still have yet to leave your little town and expand your understanding, had the submission beat into you, etc., but some of the reasons given by some of these guys are wild to me.",2

17,also the owners of the chiefs are big trump supporters. like they’ve given quite a bit to republican and trump causes. the wife of the owner made some idiotic illegal immigrant statement a few days ago. brittney may have done so to curry favor/mirror the views of the owners because her husband is the qb.,0

5,"i am actually all in favor of this ""progress"". we always had 30 to 40% assholes in this country. but they knew they had to hide it. trump let them all run free. i'm perfectly fine with having them all go back into the closet at least.",1
3,my neighbor moved his trump flag out 😳. now i know there are at least two of them on the street,2
21,"it's brought it in the open for the rest to see so it might be a good thing. the reality here though is that it's exposed so many people who are insane, racist, etc that they'll never truly be able to hide from supporting trump. look at the nazis they didn't give two fucks until they were losing the war then guess what? they'll started burning their ss uniforms and trying to hide what they did. once all this finally crashes, they're going to try and hide again, but people will forever call them out.",0
3,"i live in a very conservative small little town, and in 2020 the metric fuck ton of trump shit everywhere was sickening. however, this time around it’s far less visible. what used to be like half a dozen pickup trucks and motorcycles driving by a day with trump flags attached to the back of them has now turned into maybe that many through this whole election cycle. i don’t know if it means they won’t actually be voting for him, but it at least implies that they’re not as proud of it.",0
31,either that or brittany moves to the center. she's got nothing to gain from a trump presidency anyway.,1
14,"yes. taylor is wise enough to read people well. for that and more, taylor would be a better president than trump.",0
47,"i believe there are women out there who secretly voted for biden/harris despite telling their husbands they're trump supporters. i think secretly liberal husbands hiding their votes from their wives is probably less common, though.",0
4,my wife started as a liberal but has become brainwashed by twitter to the point where she was loudly cheering and clapping and literally got up and danced in support of trump at the last debate. to say it has put a strain on the marriage is an understatement.,0
9,there are so many people that just don't care that much (probably the majority). not every one who votes for trump is a massive trump fan and not everyone who votes against him is a massive kamala supporter. reddit makes it seem like everyone is hugely for or against trump and there is no overlap. patricks best friend is extremely liberal,0
3,"one of those undecided voters groups had a hispanic young man who favored trump, and he talked nothing but right wing talking points about illegals and crime, but qualified his parents entered legally. do you not realize trump and his allies don’t care about breaking immigration law they care that it’s about allowing more brown people into the country.",0
3,"well, she married one of the ""good ones"" right? her husband is rich and famous and she feels insulated. she feels she gets to ignore how her kids will absolutely be treated by the racist trumpers",0
15,"there’s also undue influence (aka propaganda), which manipulates the will of others via their ignorance. this has been trump’s playbook since the escalator.",2

16,"the problem is that visibility breeds acceptance. when people don't hide, the influenceable folks either start to think heinous beliefs are acceptable or that visible opposition will become more dangerous. trump's big success is that his emboldening of visible monsters has pushed the overton window so far right that the radicals from 10 years ago now look mainstream if not moderate.",2
10,"to compound on that point, this one guy who did an interview (can't remember the article) said he was a trump supporter, but immediately changed his vote, when he actually watched one one of his speeches. he said he hadn't realized how incoherent he was since he only read the tldr's and the interviews and never watched. and that the articles sounded like he knew what he was talking about. seems this also may be a running theme, so i say mainstream media and people should do word for word and stop the tldr's or coming back through and saying, 'what he meant to say was...'",0

4,"this is trump’s loser voice. he knows he’s losing at the moment, and he’s suddenly very afraid of what happens when he can no longer avoid the consequences of his criminality. guy’s trying to bargain with the universe in the middle of a political speech. fucking hilarious.",0
3,"he doesn't want to work. we saw it last time where he spent the vast majority of his time golfing and watching tv. wasn't his schedule like 60% ""executive time"" a day or some stupid shit? \* [",2
4,i’m old enough to remember when the republican party was self-described as the “law & order party”. trump put a stake through that!,0
4,this man needs to be destroyed in the election and put in prison immediately afterwards. this is the only way to end trumps reign of terror.,0
5,trump said he does not enjoy running for president and criticized state and federal prosecutors for not offering him plea deals. trump could quit. trump could move to venezuela.,2
4,"he didn't actually want to run the first time in 2016. did you see his demeanor start to change when he started to pull ahead in the poles? he genuinely started to panic because he was doing it as a publicity stunt to get his name and brand more recognizable. he did not expect to win. south park does a beautiful rendition of this. mr garrison is trump and literally tells everyone to vote for hillary, but he poisoned the well so hard he won anyway.",0
3,"oh look he is bringing up the border again. it is like complaining of forest fires while walking around lighting trees on fire. if only there was some sort of legislation to help, oh wait there was and it failed because of trump telling republicans to kill the bill.",2

3,"every other president ever has said something along the lines of “it is the honor of my life that you have chosen me and trusted me to be your leader/nominee. i am humbled to serve you.” trump: “i hate doing this. you’re all lucky i chose to ruin my life to be president. if i didn’t begrudgingly accept to be your president, the world would be chaos and probably end in nuclear war.”",0
3,"the thing about trump is that even though he ""*could*"" cop a plea on the charges; he would come right out and exclaim, ""**total exhoneration!!**"" immediately after he makes the plea. i wouldn't trust him with a plea if my life depended on it.",2
3,"he *does* realize that the conditions of a plea deal require the defendant to admit culpability, right? oh, wait. i’m asking if trump realizes something… ***\*smacks forehead\****",2
4,"the only way jack smith will give him a plea deal in the election interference case is if trump admits he lost the 2020 election and tried to overthrow it anyway, and immediately withdraws from the 2024 race. maybe he’ll agree to no prison time, but there’s no way he’s going to let trump plead guilty and still run for president.",0
2,"i'm sure if he wanted a plea deal they'd give him one, maybe cut the sentences down to just a few years in prison instead of a life sentence. somehow i think trump is just lying here.",0
2,putin will never allow him to drop out of this race. trump is in too deep.,1
2,"honestly i think it's a possibility after the election. trump gives harris the choice between letting him walk or continuing to destabilize the us. i can see the federal charges being dropped and a lot pressure being put on state prosecutors to drop charges or argue for no prison time. of course the problem is ensuring trump keeps his promise, and of course that maga extremists don't just keep going.",1
2,"yes, he fucking likes doing this. he knows everyone wants him out of our lives. he wants to make sure he can make us as miserable as possible. that's what a narcissist does to their captured group. for the sake of my already ruined mental health, i really need this country to put this trump filth behind us permanently.",0
2,"he said during the biden debate: ""i'd rather be anywhere else."" and continued to ramble on for 2 minutes about not wanting to be president. this was trump on a national broadcast, during a debate, going i don't want to be president, i don't want to be here. that was almost 3 months ago.",2
2,i would love to see trump quit before the election so he doesn’t have to go through losing 😂,0
2,"on trumps first 100 days in office he said: “i loved my previous life. i had so many things going,” trump told reuters in an interview. “this is more work than in my previous life. i thought it would be easier.” no shit, sherlock.",0
2,"the internal polling probably shows that trump is going to lose to harris. and the reality of losing to a women, and a black women at that, is simply too much for trump to handle or process. so i honestly wouldn't be surprised if trump did take a plea deal and drop out of the race to avoid the humiliation of losing to harris.",0

2,trump is an old boring golfing retiree. simple as that.,2
2,"the fact that he states he will imprison his does should scare the shit out of us all. he will strip thousands of civil service workers out of their jobs, even if they have worked for years. and replace them with maga cronies and ship legal citizens out because of their heritage. if you think i am wrong, read or wake up and smell the garbage of a trump administration.",0
2,trump said he was running only because biden was running. what's his excuse now? something something presidential pardons...,2
2,"why does he need a plea deal? he's not under arrest, no one has charged him with anything, merrick garland is working overtime to shield him and protect him, and democrats have made it crystal clear that investigating a republican would be super unfair and biased so they're not going to do it. matt gaetz raped and trafficked a minor and he gets to go free forever. donald trump masterminded the overthrow of our government and nobody's doing a thing about it. why does he need a plea deal? nobody's doing anything about the crimes he committed. he's fine.",0
1,"most of trump's co-conspirators were offered plea deals to provide evidence or testify against trump. prosecutors don't offer the kingpin a plea deal, trump is the target for full punishment. somebody should tell him.",0
1,"to accept a plea deal, one has to plead guilty. trump would never do that. his idea of a plea deal is he doesn’t plead guilty to anything, but they drop the charges and maybe charge him a few bucks for court costs, which he will then claim he’s being victimized and get them to drop. meanwhile, he launches another funding campaign proclaiming his innocence with money going into his pocket and the campaign never sees it. besides, a plea deal isn’t a public event, so it doesn’t let him hold a press conference getting anywhere near the free publicity that’s essentially a campaign ad at no cost to him. the whole thing is a grift where he asks for a plea deal and then claims it’s a trap because they would still want him to admit to committing crimes and want some form of reduced punishment for it. i think all he wants is playing the victim where he offered to not admit to anything and have all charges dropped and then they reneged on the deal.",2
1,"is trump gunning for an exchange of a plea deal, and he will step down as the nominee?",0
1,makes sense. i couldn’t imagine he liked being president. trump is lazy - he wouldn’t want people bothering him all the time. he wouldn’t want to read boring stuff. it’s just about getting the power to do whatever he wants and make money (dictator) and staying out of prison.,0

1,"i think we've got a way to jail trump without a lengthy trial. it's some looney tunes stuff though: we tell donny that the plea deal in a small concrete cube where it smells of defeat and broken spirits. we then tell him that no one can help him get and that only the person it's written for can touch it. we'll then assure him by telling him to not because we'll be holding the heavy door open for him. as he's about to walk in, we'll mention that it's be pretty embarrassing to trip on that stick with a string attached that's propping open the door. when he grabs the blank piece of paper, we pull the string. done, trump in jail. lol",0

151,"i think a plea deal would be fine. one of the things about plea deals is they speed up the process significantly... and yet we know trump is trying everything possible to drag out the court cases he's in. i don't think trump fully understands, or is deliberately trying to misrepresent what a plea deal is. generally, a plea deal means confessing to some or all of the charges in exchange for a more lenient sentence, which may mean reduced jail time and so on. at no point is any plea deal going to get him out of jail, however, so trump even suggesting he would like a plea deal so he can be sentenced more quickly comes across here as a plain weird thing for him to say.",0
16,"they should--okay, excuse me, just so you understand--they call it plea deals, okay, they do plea deals, and they do a lot of them, believe me, they do the deals with everyone else, every other--but then they file these cases, and they're such fake cases; they're crooked, fake cases, and they call it lawfare, but it's weaponization and it's fake case--and they really are by the way, they're fake cases, they say, oh, threat to democracy, oh, he led an inshurresh, but it's such phony--but the department, i call it the department of injustice, believe me, because it really is, but they do it with everyone, everyone gets a plea deal--but then it comes to the weaponish--and you look, and it's no plea deal for trump, believe me, don't do a deal, can't do a deal with trump, won't allow it; they're not allowed, by their masters, believe me--but it's a crooked system and what they're doing is so bad for the country, and it's sad, and it's truly, if you want to know, i think it's a terrible.",1
3,"what he's asking for is very common in elected politics, just not at the presidential level. criminal charges often can be a bargaining chip to get someone to resign or drop out of a race. it happened last year in st. louis with their da who had charges dropped in exchange for resigning from office. seems like someone got the idea into trump's head that he could drop out in exchange for charges being dropped but nobody is interested in that argument.",2

61,i firmly believe that he never even expected to win in 2016. i think he ran for president to promote his trump brand and get a bunch of business but i think he fully expected hillary to win. the fact that he didn't even have a transition team and how surprised he seemed when he gave his victory speech makes me think this.,0
91,"that’s the only reason, trump is running. he is trying to stay out of jail",0
26,"of course he is. he didn’t give two shits about his felony convictions because he thought he had the presidency in the bag against biden and was going to immediately pardon himself. he never wanted to be president in the first place and certainly doesn’t want it again. he just wants the optics of being president, which is why he has no problem with people like the heritage foundation making all his policies for him and bringing in a bunch of other people to run the show. he doesn’t care what happens to the country, only to himself. now that harris is in the race and trump losing is a reality, he’s starting to freak out because now he’s going to have to face legal justice, hence begging for a plea deal instead.",0
13,"like trump, hitler was also constantly hopped up on speed and downplayed in the press (including the ny times) as just being a ""fiery orator"" who didn't really mean the rhetoric he spouted. personally i think the trajectory of human history on into the present is a kind of strange loop, where we regularly return to the same kinds of ""inflection points"" as in times past but hopefully with each new repetition, we've learned some things and will respond differently than people did in times past. hopefully.",0

2,"i believe the purpose in delaying the sentencing is that it would permit merchan to sentence trump even if he is elected. on nov 26th, the worst case scenario is trump is president elect... but that does not make him president yet, nor does he hold any executive power. merchan cannot be blamed for election interference if he imprisons trump after the election has taken place.",0

3,"no, only fools willing to pay $80/ share thought that it was ever worth that number, since this is a penny stock with zero fundamentals behind it. it generates no income, has massive expenses, and will quickly go to zero when he loses. rick wilson, famous anti-trumper of the lincoln project, wrote a book in 2018 called, ""everything trump touches dies"". the last few years have only confirmed and accelerated that reality. trump knows that ""truth social"" is a scam, and it will die as soon as he loses this election. the loan is a tool to salvage value from a sinking ship. we are dealing with a narcissistic psychopath here. he wants to be the 47th president because he wants revenge, he wants to stay out of prison, and he wants to grift any fucking dime he can, for the next four years. it really is that simple.",0

(moore was obsessed with the vietnam war and thought that assassinating ford would spark a violent national revolution.) but he did not blame his opponents for the attempts on his life. he did not blame america, or the courts, or anyone else. he also did not use the attacks by moore and fromme to fundraise: trump used his attacks to beat the bushes for money within a few hours. instead, ford acceded to the secret service’s request that he start wearing a trench coat with a zip-in kevlar vest. (it was very uncomfortable and he disliked wearing it.) he then went back out in public and conducted a presidential campaign, which he lost.",0

5,yes [ >> pulitzer-prize winning reporter michael d'antonio nabbed the quotable gem during his six hours of interviews with the real estate king.<<,2
22,"i hope you're right, but unfortunately the power of social media, the power of racism, the power of the fascist playbook, decades of research of psychological warfare, etc. are all being harnessed, and it's formidable and frankly terrifying. meanwhile the federalist society is waiting in the wings. they all got trump elected the first time around, and now everyone from putin to musk to american rightwing oligarchs are harnessing everything they can for a final push to permanently kneecap american democracy. these are absolutely insane times. politics used to be kinda boring and i wish it still was. hell, look at clips of the debates between obama and romney, obama and mccain, bush and kerry, bush and gore, etc. such absolutely insane times we're living in. this is an election that will echo through american history in a very, very critical way.",0
2,i hope he’s alive in 2028 to run again. then in 2032 the republicans will split between the old guard and those trying to replicate trump and have extremely low turnout. 16-20 years of democrats in the white house would have a huge correcting effect on this country.,0
4,"dude, wtf are you talking about. even with the latest polls. the election is still up in the air. trump still has a path to victory. vote as if your life depends on it.",0
81,yeah private jets suck but does anyone realistically think she’d be able to fly commercial without getting mobbed (by fans or trump weirdos)?,0
7,"that’s exactly what he did during his term. put his people in place. he has stacked the supreme court, going so far as to deny obama the chance to appoint a justice when it was perfectly legal for him to do so. if trump gets back into office he has his people in place and ready to implement project 2025 which he insists he is unaware of. the only reason the 2020 election did not go to him is because people did their jobs, not his bidding. this time around the people in charge of certifying the election are loyal to trump. if this isn’t a blue wave, it’s doubtful even a harris win will be certified.",1
28,"maybe you aren't seeing what i've been seeing. aside from the way kamala has reinvigorated the voter base and celebs like taylor swift backing her, a growing number of old school republicans have come out not only against trump but for kamala/walz. they are choosing democracy over fascism regardless of the party or other disagreements on policy, etc. we need to keep fighting because nothing is guaranteed but remember that when we get enough people out to vote the democrats win easy and don't forget that trump only won last time because of the gerrymandering the republicans have been working on for decades, hillary won the popular vote and if we didn't have the electoral college we wouldn't have had 4 years of the orange menace.",1
1,"here's the thing to understand about primaries, turnout is ridiculously low. because of that, even relatively small number of people can have an outsized effect on who wins. maga was able to do it twice. the tea party was able to bump of all kinds of republican incumbents in the primaries between 2010 and 2014. if trump tries to run again in 2028, i think you will see a significant uptick in primary turnout on the republican side to ensure that doesn't happen again.",2
2,"that’s the really scary part. even with everything we know about trump now and his imminent meltdown, he is still polling high. i can’t believe people still think he should be in the white house but they do. so the election is still very much up in the air. we can’t be complacent. if we don’t get out in high enough numbers he could very well win!",0
-2,"dude, learn how to see what is happening in real time and extrapolate how that will affect things in the future. i agree that we can't stop fighting but if you can't see how trump and his mentally ill followers are destroying their movement from the inside, i question if you should be doing anything without a chaperone.",2
3,"i underestimated the mental illness of the tea partiers who morphed into the gqp/maga. i thought they would drop trump and forget he ever existed when he lost last time, boy was i wrong. i'm also not looking forward to what could happen on/after the election when kamala/walz win. difference is now we are seeing it play out in real time and it's accelerating. trump has been draining the rnc coffers to pay for his lawyers which leaves very little for other republicans to campaign with. those of us saying this years ago were right we were just ahead of ourselves.",0
1,"hillary didn't have the gravitas that kamala has. i for one was definitely not expecting a blue wave in 16 and no one i know expected it either, i for one was actually paying attention to what was going on. i'm getting tired of teaching people history and civics every time this shit gets discussed. hillary won the popular vote. the republicans have gerrymandering so many districts that there was no chance of a blue wave to back hillary up if she had actually won and the only reason she lost was because of the aforementioned gerrymandered districts that gave the electoral college to trump. i remind you that very very very few republican presidents have actually won the popular vote, most of them became president because of the electoral college in states that the republicans have been working on gerrymandering for decades if not longer. the majority of the people in this country believe in most of the ideals and goals of the democrats and when enough people get their ass out of the house and vote, those ideals are given a chance to become reality. and to repeat at the risk of downvotes but fuck it. you lot can't read so i'll repeat. we need to keep fighting but if we act like we have already lost, how are we going to find the will to keep up the fight? we will win because we have to. the torch has finally been handed down to the next generation who knows how to fight dirty without getting in the mud with the fascists. this is how and why we will win, coupled with the republicans destroying themselves from within. and as i said a couple of paragraphs up. go ahead and downvote these comments into the ground and then you can go vote for trump because you clearly don't believe in being educated and you can't stand being told things straight up which makes you the snowflakes the gqp are always talking about. i'm going to turn these notifications off so i won't be responding further.",0
14,"i deeply, deeply hope you're right. i'm cautiously optimistic, but part of me won't allow myself to relax until i see kamala sworn in. truth be told, i'm not sure i've even fully processed trump's first term. hell take the fact that they got to take over the supreme court (y'know, that lil minor detail!!!).",1
14,"i like to mention these two names because on one hand you have elon who could do business from an office and does not need to fly into a new city every week like a pop star on tour and is directly connected to the trump campaign. on the other hand you have travis scott, who does go on tour but if you google “travis scott tour” you get a plethora of bad pr and he is directly connected to the kardashians, more billionaires she hates. you can’t talk about how bad she is for the environment without mentioning these two who are arguably worse.",0
7,"i know what they are talking about and i was one of the ones talking about putin using facebook to manipulate people long before it was more accepted as truth. i understand and hold the same scepticism and caution but i also make sure to remember that maybe 1 or 2 (don't remember exactly) republican presidents win the popular vote. most of the republican presidents we have had only won because of the electoral college. i also remember that when the people get out of the house and vote, sanity and common sense win the day. this is why trumps handlers are so focused on voter suppression because they can't win otherwise. i'd feel more like the other commenter if trump was a) way more intelligent and b) a good 20 years younger and way more mentally fit. as it stands trump is melting down and so is the rest of the maggats, they are too busy fighting each other to mount any real campaign against anyone they are facing at the polls. as i and others keep saying. we can't stop fighting. but, i am feeling more hope for the future than i have in a long time. if i felt like trump had a real shot at winning along with the rest of the idiots on the right, my wife and i would be working harder on getting ourselves setup to move out of the country if democracy falls this november.",0

4,"and that's why i think the people worried this might give trump a boost are wrong. give it a couple days, then hammer home how under her plans, this many couldn't have gotten a gun due to prior convictions. while trump tries to blame a political party, she should put the focus on blaming the failed policies of the past.",0

3,"i think he sounds like a republican, because he supported haley, so probably doesn't like either side. more news came out and he wanted to fight for ukraine— so i think the driving factor behind his hatred is if trump is elected he will help putin commit a genocide of ukrainians. i think this man was probably old school regan republican. if someone is old school republican they want to keep the nato alliance, do not support putin, and want russians to stay in russia.",1

120,"because trump mentioned germany in his closing statement, i (a german) want to do quick fact check. trump claimed that germany tried to transition to renewable energy for a year, failed and is now building ""normal"" (i guess he means conventional) power plants again. to the surprise of no one, everything about that statement is wrong. the transition to renewable energy in germany is going on for about 25 years. it didn't fail, but is rapidly picking up speed in the last few years. in 2023, over 50% of the produced electricity in germany was renewable, while germany is still a net exporter. today renewables are already in the 60% area. we certainly don't go back to conventional power plants. for example the percentage of coal has gone down from over 80% in the 1990s to below 18% today. the plan is still to be at 100% renewable before 2035. oh. and don't get me started with trump's claim that the world is laughing at the us under biden, while having respected it under trump. just remember when trump held a weird maga speech in front of the un assembly and hundreds of top diplomats from all over the world laughed in his face. that sums it up how trumps america was/is seen in the world. if trump is reelected, europe and the other allies of the us will prepare to move on without the us, because trump is considered as weak (easy to manipulate by dictators) and unreliable. the us would become increasingly irrelevant globally.",1

41,"he looked like a fool because he was only trying to spit out talking point his handlers gave him. he literally doesn’t know what he’s talking about. eg. “i don’t talk to vance” -well of course not. trump hasn’t discussed anything with anyone because a) he thinks he knows everything and b) he won’t don’t the research and c) he literally doesn’t understand the issues at hand. he expects to walk into that office and push a button for a diet coke, then pay off his legal bills with campaign funds. all the real work is done by other people. furthermore - this is why project 2025 is so heinous. the people who wrote that know he’s just gonna give them free reign.",0
37,"i feel like because there was so much insanity last night people aren’t even talking about trump doubling down on 9 month, and after birth abortions. like, eating cats is one thing, but that and baby executions is just so detached from reality. he just says the most insane, baseless soundbites for his base and they eat it up. he’s so far behind mentally unfit to serve it’s crazy. the double standard his supporters have for him, in comparison to biden or harris is baffling.",0
43,if you check the conservative sub there are barely any threads about the debate. that about sums it up. trump lost bigly and even they know it.,0
180,"32 years old, never cared about politics, never watched a presidential debate, and i've never voted. after what i just witnessed, i went and quickly registered to vote online. trump and his supporters are the most fried individuals on the planet. i will be voting for harris.",1
82,"the look on harris' face when trump brought up the ""haitians eating pets"" meme suggested that she couldn't believe her luck. the world's biggest rake was sitting there with safety cones all around it and he jumped on it with both feet.",0
39,"i love the people nitpicking kamala because she wasn't perfect, and then saying trump wasn't bad. i feel like i'm in an alternate dimension.",0
39,"abc has walz on and he literally just called trump an ""old man yelling at clouds!"" love this guy!",0
36,"i’ve learned everything i’ve needed about harris’ character. during the debate i found myself pivoting from voting to not have trump, to voting because i admire part of kamala’s demeanor. policy aside, i believe she has made one major accomplishment, and that’s getting the undecided and unknowing voter to know exactly her character and who she is. this is going to have tremendous effect on polling.",0
38,trump supporters: “why are all kamala’s questions softballs that let her dunk on trump and all his questions make him look dumb?” dude you’re *almost* there.,0
38,trump could not look in her direction all night. kamala made him give her a handshake. it is clear who was in control. he lost.,1
40,"man, harris pausing for a second to stop herself from calling trump a motherfucker was the highlight of the evening for me. we were all thinking it. i wouldn't have blamed her one bit for saying it.",0
38,hey so you want to know how bad this is? trump is in the spin room and not a single network is carrying it.,2
37,according to the cnn instant poll trump lost this debate as badly as biden lost the june one.,2
38,the 37% claiming trump won are just blatantly lying on the cnn poll,2
37,juan carlos (red shirt) on msnbc was voting for trump all along. he’s an immigrant and his biggest issue is closing the border. he’s a box of rocks.,0
38,"as much as i appreciated the at least semi-flaccid attempts at factchecking, i could not believe how much the moderators let trump walk all over their attempts to control the conversation. it seemed like every time he wanted to have the last word on something, they’d just unmute him regardless of if the moderator was trying to move on. and of course the same leeway was not granted to harris. did it work in her favor though to be seen compared to the insane rambling?",0
38,"after birth abortions, immigrants eating cats and dogs. trump campaign staff going to have its work cut out for them trying to explain and spin all the crazy shit he said during the debate. this is what you get when your nominate a pathological liar that has dementia.",0
34,trump why all dictators love him. he's an idiot.,1
38,"""mr. trump, tell us why you opposed the bi partisan border bill..."" ""ok, but i'm going to address the crowd size accusation instead, then i'm going to complain about immigrants.""",0
37,"it has been really euphoric waking up to all the debate news. >kamala harris and donald trump have debated for the first time - with ms harris's favourability ratings up afterwards. she has also earned the endorsement of taylor swift. moderators pointed out lies from mr trump and one tv commentator described his performance as ""as bad as biden"". \- skynews",2
40,"trumps entire agenda is to instill fear. every time he spoke, it was about saying the most dreadful fearful thing he could think of. people are getting worn out. it's losing its impact. his die hard supporters eat it up but it's getting old to everyone else.",0
42,that was brutal for trump. harris absolutely destroyed him. i don't know how any sane and free thinking person can look at trump and feel he's the right person for the job. last night trump put on full display just how out of touch with reality he truly is. he came across as an old lunatic relying on fear mongering and lies. harris on the other hand put up one of the best debate performances i've ever seen in my lifetime. she came across as calm cool and collected. trump looked like a disaster.,0
70,what terrifies me the most is the fact that there are millions of americans who will still vote for trump no matter what,0
63,can we be done with this abominable moron now? kamala absolutely killed it and trump shit himself. if this doesn't make a dent in the perception of undecided voters i have no fucking idea what will.,0
61,"and here we see on display, a fundamental difference between the dems and republicans. biden did horrible in his debate and democrats acknowledged it. trump went full blown boomer crazy conspiracy on tv last night and republicans refuse to acknowledge it.",0
33,fox is currently saying this could be looked at as a disappointment for trump,0
29,"wow, the amount of times that trump interrupted others and dodged questions. they asked him 'yes' or 'no' questions and he would go on a rant and not take a stance either way.",0
30,"when trump said immigrants are eating pets and was corrected and he responded, ""but i saw it on the tv"" it makes you realize trump isn't directing this braindead maga cult, he's also just.. one of them.",0
36,"it kills me because trump, i believe, legitimately lost the election tonight. he looked stupid, weak, and sounded extreme, stupid, and incoherent. yet, the only reason he has a shot at winning still is because of the electoral college.",0
34,taylor swift just formally endorsed harris/walz on social media after the debate. trump is cooked.,2
31,trump saying he has a concept of a plan is me when i am asked about how my university essay is cloming along,2
33,"i think the highlight for me was trump essentially saying, ""i have a concept of a plan. i know what a plan is. i don't have one, but if i saw one, i could point it out to you,"" and just how that encapsulates his entire platform.",2
30,pay attention to the things trump didn’t say. he didn’t disagree with loving dictators. he didn’t say he would stand with ukraine.,0
29,"oh god the cnn undecided panel is on and these people want me to throw things at the tv as they have people repeat republican talking points as they pretend to be undecided. lol and the ""undecided"" voter who thought trump did better voted from him in 2016 and 2020",2
32,moderator (regarding an aca alternative): “do you have a plan?” trump: “i have concepts of a plan” almost spit out my beer at that one,2
29,i’ll be honest: my day was super rough. it was one of those workdays where i felt completely stupid. i feel better after hearing from the “undecided” voter who had voted for trump twice already,0
31,this dude talking about how they left equipment in the hands of the enemy and blaming it on biden instead of trump who made the entire plans tells you just how smart and open he was.,2
30,maybe trump should drop out after this disastrous debate and stand aside to let a new generation carry the torch. jd vance will surely turn things around. especially after trump said he had no idea what jd is talking about with respect to abortion.,2
33,"i found it interesting that trump only talked about the loss of russian soldiers as a reason he would ""end"" the war in 24 hours, not ukrainians",0
31,"[ trump supporters are melting. they have a conspiracy: 'earphones embedded in her earrings'. the implied part is that she did well. however, the explicit conspiracy is that it must be someone else coaching her with her responses. my answer. maybe you all should have invested in some earrings for trump?",2
29,"that coward trump is trying to walk the tightrope on abortion. he refuses to say what he will do in hopes that voters will assume that he will be on their side. make no mistake, roe is dead because of the justices that donald trump appointed to the supreme court. women in states across america have lost their bodily autonomy because of donald trump. we already know where trump stands on abortion. he will sign a nationwide ban on abortions if the radical right in congress put it on his desk as president.",0

32,"from what i saw, he only looked at her during the handshake. never looked at her again. harris constantly looked at trump. i think that says something. much easier to lie about someone when you aren't looking at them.",2
29,"trump spoke for 42 minutes & 52 seconds, while harris spoke for 37 minutes & 36 seconds. they gave trump 5 extra minutes of rebuttal time.",2

35,"i just can't believe anyone watched this debate and said ""oh yeah, trump absolutely destroyed harris"", or ""can't believe they're fact checking trump but not harris"". the first point is just nonsensical, but for the second point, he has a track record of just saying off the wall shit to try and make a point, he needs to be fact checked. trying to convince people that there are states that allow infanticide, like....the fuck?",1
31,i keep reading and seeing republicans whine that abc was unfair to trump but don’t see any specifics on why. is it because they pointed out it’s never been legal to kill a baby after they’ve been born and the migrants aren’t eating your cats?,2

32,"i read a lot of comments complaining that the moderators let trump speak over time when they should have switched off his microphone. i would argue the more he rambled, the more he hurt himself, while harris looked composed and presidential in contrast.",1
29,"trump responded as you'd expect. if you read ""the cult of trump,"" you'll realize his low self esteem runs his life. it's why he showed up after refusing to debate anywhere but fox news because kamala said she'd take up all the attention. it's why he got stuck on her calling him ""weak"" and why he simply had to respond to her comments about his rallies. trump needs attention. his father taught him that. and he doesn't know how to exist in a world where he doesn't have it.",0
32,"i feel like him chickening out and not doing the debate would have been far less damaging that this was tonight. i don't expect to see him willing to debate her again. but i can already also see the faux news spin. hannity will repeat his lie from last time that trump was debating the moderator and harris, just because the moderator was fact checking trump",2
31,"i do not really take part in this political discussion much, being european. however, i would just like to point out this one aspect which tellingly stood out to me. kamala harris is taking notes constantly, she is paying attention. for the entire debate, i could not tell a single time donald trump took a single note. as harris said, ""same old tired playbook."" he's a tape on repeat.",0
32,"so we all agree that harris won, right? trump looked completely manic and deranged- like a crazy uncle at thanksgiving dinner that everyone hopes won’t show up.",0
29,"i'm still giddy from how well the debate went. harris wasn't perfect but she was on point and used her time well. i look forward to seeing her do more rallies and town halls to fill any gaps that she couldn't go into detail about during the debate. trump was a complete wreck. he couldn't stay on topic, he muttered ridiculous lies, doubled down on trying to steal the election and flat out admitted that he has zero plans. side by side we had a confused old man that is likely to believe facebook chain letters and a calm but determined person with actual plans for america. make no mistake though, while this was a great debate for harris, sadly this race will forever be close. vote!",1
29,i don’t understand how any sane person could vote for trump now. he let us all know he has absolutely no plan for the people. just whatever benefits him and it’s really scary he couldn’t answer the question on ukraine winning. that shows you exactly who owns trump.,0
34,"i don’t get why i haven’t seen any commentary on trump saying kamala “put out” that was one of the wildest things he’s ever said, to me",0
31,this debate wasn't even close and it's just staggering that some independent voters that were interviewed after watching the debate felt trump had the better performance. did we watch the same thing?,2
35,that was the most incoherent rambling i have heard since.... trumps last time he talked publicly,0
30,"i don’t know how you could be an undecided voter and not vote for kamala after this debate. trump made so many empty statements, had a couple of good arguments, but absolutely embarrassed himself on several occasions whereas kamala spoke eloquently, explained her positions and plans, and her calls to action were impeccable. from a purely objective standpoint, kamala won this debate and hopefully the supposed millions of undecided voters.",0
61,hey. you. if you skipped the debate out of anxiety and are browsing reddit looking for how the debate went? here's the answer: watch the debate. it fuckin ruled. harris wiped the floor with trump.,0
59,"clinton and biden didn’t do too terrible in their debates with donald trump, but harris managed to do what they and the republicans in the primaries couldn’t: a complete and total takedown. she completely eviscerated him. what’s even more hilarious is that joe biden’s terrible debate performance on 6/27 provided so much cover for trump’s performance. the way he performed tonight is exactly the same way he performed at the 6/27 debate. the way she talked substance while also managing to bait him was a master class performance.",0
55,"holy shit, fox news is saying this is an absolute disgrace for trump",0
26,people saying harris didn't win are on something else. this was a concrete beatdown by harris. it won't sway any trump voters because nothing will. but i honestly think genuine moderates or folks on the fence that saw or listened to this have a lot more reasons/justification to vote for harris. trump looked and sounded completely incompetent.,0

26,i am biased as fuck but i cannot see any reasonable person coming out of this thinking trump looks like the better person for the job.,2
26,ben shapiro on x: “this debate won’t matter. it was just eliminated as an inflection point. the american people still know nothing about kamala harris’ positions. donald trump is still donald trump. and the legacy media are still a giant flaming dog turd.” you know you’re in a bad position when you have to say things like “this debate won’t matter.”,0

25,"you know, taylor swift was probably going to stay out of all this until trump posted those fake ai images of her endorsing him. trump is his own worst enemy. he pissed off taylor and she was very calculating in when she was going to respond to make sure it does the maximum damage to him. damn taylor, she's a stoned cold killer.",0

47,i’m convinced anyone who’s still “undecided” at this point are people who want to vote for trump but don’t really like him personally.,0

29,so abc let trump rant on and on and cut off kamala every time. let's see if any meaningful media reports on that.,2

28,"every time they ask trump a question he never answers it. it always devolves into a rant about something unrelated. it's pretty damn terrifying that people still support him so strongly. at least kamala stays on track and actually explains her policies, trump himself said all he has are ""concepts"" of a plan",0

165,kamala looking like the american president tonight. looking him straight in the eye and not backing down while he stammers about anything else other than the question. trump looks defeated.,0
81,"i think somebody needs to remind trump that biden is not running for president of the united states, and also that biden is *not the president of europe*.",2
73,my conservative dad just laughed and turned off the tv before the debate ended. trump’s toast,2
68,what is the point of muted mics if trump can just burst in and get the final minute every time???,0
62,"debate so far: trump: migrants, migrants, migrants, migrants, migrants, migrants, migrants, migrants, migrants, mgrinats, nstrmgira, taimrgns !!! dude can't remember anything else.",0
295,i hope biden is watching and enjoying every minute of trump getting owned,1
288,trump won't commit to ukraine's victory. figures,0
62,"if you’re stupid enough to question why kamala isn’t getting fact checked, it’s because she isn’t fucking spewing out lies like trump you dumbasses",0
60,"trump's entire debate so far. ""no u"" ""100 million illegal terrorists""",0
61,"it is no accident that harris isn't objecting to trump's extra time. trump hurts himself every time he speaks. she baits him to talk about what she wants, and then watches him implode.",0
57,its really frustrating that they always let trump have the last quip for every issue regardless of who the question was posed to,0
57,"i feel like them letting trump talk is absolutely by design. they want him to come across as absolutely insane. harris is much more calm, collected, while still firing shots. i may not agree with her policies regarding israel and fracking, but she's killing it. just to be clear, you can absolutely disagree with a politician while still liking them.",0
52,why does trump keep getting the final comment for each topic?,2
49,on the one hand it's not fair for trump to get that much more speaking time. on the other hand it feels like he's digging a bigger hole for himself each time he speaks,0
53,“donald trump got fired by 81 million people” goddamn get in there! fucking burn 🔥,0
52,trump can’t fucking answer a question,0
94,"kamala's answer about how globally embarrassing trump's continued election denial comments are, which try to undermine faith in our democracy, might have been her strongest moment so far imo",0
43,trump going for the hungarian dictator vote.,1
46,trump is failing so hard. and seething with anger. i'm so happy.,0
48,why does trump get the last word everytime? mute the fucking mic,0
49,they are moving towards constantly letting him rebut regardless. trump is already at 33% more talk time than kamala. lock that down.,0
45,"how does any reasonable and at least competently educated american vote for donald trump? this is truly bizarro world he is polling so high, he should be a 5% looney tunes candidate.",0
46,they need to shut off trump's mic instead of letting him jump in and get the last word on every issue. ridiculous,0
46,these moderators seriously need to stop letting trump railroad like he has. cut his mic when it isn't his turn and he's gone over time. it's just insane rambling and lies that have nothing to do with the actual talking points anyway.,0
43,i really admire the job harris is doing here. she has pegged her responses beautifully to both address the public and goad trump into ranting. and i think the occasional quaver she has is a masterful way of undercutting accusations of her being strident or bitchy.,0
47,why does trump always get the last response and then the next question? they need to do a better job of cutting him off when he forces himself in with free response time..,1
49,trump started going downhill after kamala attacked his crowd size and he’s been getting more unhinged since.,0
128,i feel like trump is being allowed to respond to every accusation and kamala never gets the last word?,0
44,abc really needs to stop letting trump go into overtime,0
44,why does trump get the last word on every fucking question with an unhinged rant.,0
40,so...i guess mics can remain on as long as its for trump huh,2
42,donald trump was fired by 81 million people is my new favorite retort.,0
42,"trump's looking like a beaten dog. avoiding her gaze when she addresses him directly, body language pushing her away with the raised left shoulder. he's getting beaten and he knows it, and now he's tired and angry.",0
33,they ask trump yes or no questions but make kamala give a thesis statement for her answers,0
37,sooo did the mute for trumps mic break?,0
39,“i fired trump” would make a good t-shirt,0
35,"not watching because i cannot stand to see or hear trump, but live reporting on wapo and the nyt suggests harris is wiping the floor with him. i hope she keeps this up until the end.",1
36,"these hosts need to grab some balls and press the mute button. trump gets the last word on every single fucking topic, which is exactly what he and his base are hoping for. make a ridiculous, erroneous declaration about something that has nothing to do with the topic then immediately pivot to the next topic. let kamala call him out on this bullshit.",0
36,clearly trump is held to a different standard on his mic time….,2
32,"kamala is bodying trump. dude keeps saying the same thing over and over, while also not answering questions about himself.",0
37,kamala: answers the question at hand trump: “millions of immigrants….”,0
38,one thing that stuck out to me was when trump said he hasn’t really spoken to jd vance about abortion.,2
35,"this is your guy, trump supporters? lmao",1
35,kamala: your rallies are weird and you say weird stuff. trump: people are eating dogs and eating cats in the streets,0
32,"this is going so much better for us than the first debate, trump is unhinged. kamala just dishing the zingers",0
31,"ok, so every topic is obviously just going to be harris thoughtfully answering the question and trump rambling like an insane person about nonsense.",0
30,"""they know they can manipulate you!"" - harris *nodding* - trump",2
30,kind of bullshit they keep cutting off harris but let trump ramble to 10 minutes at a time,0
28,"""trump is weak and wrong on national security"" stings!",0
31,"y’all no one ever talks to trump like this, lol he’s never had to sit thru such.",0
32,trump's entire gameplan for tonight: 1. immigration bad 2. no u,2
32,kamala wanted trump's mic unmuted for this reason. let him keep rambling.,0
31,"kamala gets warned about time, trump gets to say whatever he wants as often as he needs to",0
29,"kamala is tearing into him with facts, not insults. the facts do all the work. and it's working so well. trump's skin is tissue-paper thin.",2
32,"i don't get how the moderators are enforcing strict time limits on harris, while letting trump literally go on tangents upon tangents as long as he wants",0
31,is trump really adopting a pro-russia stance…here…on this stage?,1
33,every trump retort is just “no u”,0
31,she's doing fucking amazing. proving competence alone and presenting policys and making a fool of trump so he cant steamroll is gonna boost her,0
36,nord stream 2 began construction in 2018 during trump's administration.,1
30,anybody else feel stupider every time trump speaks?,0
32,im starting to think this trump guy might not be a good choice for president,0
32,harris started off seeming a bit nervous but it looks like she's found her groove. got in a couple well timed shots and trump is just getting angrier and angrier.,0
29,"everytime he brings up immigration, the moderators need to bring back the question of why he killed the border bill. they let it slide and trump continues to bring up immigration.",2
35,"is it me or is trump doing horribly? if you're not a total political insider who is familiar with his ramblings, if you are coming into this election fresh, how are you supposed to follow anything he says?",2
33,“okay but let’s talk about immigration” -trump after dodging every direct question.,2
36,trump is seething and i'm loving every moment of this lmao,1
33,why is trump given an extra 2 mins every single time before moving on to the next question?,2
29,"trump said he ""ended the nord stream two pipeline, and biden put it back on day one."" politifact have rated a version of that claim [mostly false]( more than 90% of nord stream 2 was built under trump's watch. trump imposed sanctions in december 2019 on the subsea pipeli﻿ne that carries natural gas from russia to germany. but experts say the sanctions did not stop the project; they only slowed its completion. some european contractors stepped away from the project but russian contractors replaced them. in may 2021, biden waived the sanctions to repair bilateral relations with germany. the pipeline was completed in september 2021 but germany has yet to bring it into operation because of the russia-ukraine war. in may 2022, biden [reimposed]( sanctions for similar reasons.",0
34,"trump got cooked, idk how you recover from something like this, kamala really beating expectations rn.",0
30,an hour into this debate and not a single policy proposal from trump. just yelling about the border and sucking off orban and putin.,2
30,"the one thing that is clear from donald trump’s responses: donald trump will never take personal accountability. it’s always blame someone else, deflect to another topic, and cry foul.",0
36,"i like how trump said he would broker a peace deal between ukraine and russia before he's even president, immediately incriminating himself.",1
35,it's great to watch trump do what he does best: shit the bed.,1
33,harris isn’t wrong about foreign allies / military leaders making fun of trump. i’m active duty in the military and i’ve spoken to numerous people from our allied nations across the sea and they all hate trump and don’t understand how we let him come into power,1
33,"*""president trump, you have one minute to respond to the vice president."" 5 minutes later, trump is still mangling the english like no one ever before. jeebus, how is this race even close?",1
32,"honestly unless kamala has a massive gaffe, she has won the debate. trump has been off the rails both answering any questions and talked about the haitian dog eating scandal. dude has lost the plot and spiraling",0
31,i was nervous really early but trumps crazy.,0
32,"somewhere, there's an old guy eating a possum saying ""trump gonna save my dogs from those haiti people.""",0
35,"i like how the exact moment i turned on the debate, trump was talking about people eating dogs.",0
28,"it's really cute that some people think trump is stilling hanging on in this debate. next we'll here how kamala was ""too negative"" and how she was a ""bully"" to the poor orange baby.",0
35,"“president trump, what’s your plan to stimulate the economy?” “they’re eating cats!!!”",0
32,"biden killed the keystone pipeline? no he didn't. [it's still there, still working.]( it's 2,147 miles long and pumps a maximum of 860,000 barrels of oil through its 39 pumping stations a day. is trump feeling ok?",0
55,"not once has trump looked at kamala. he is losing this so fucking hard, and it’s glorious.",1
27,lmao trump citing orban like it's a good thing.,1
27,trump is literally proving he can be easily flattered by foreign authoritarian dictators. national security achilles heel.,0
27,trump already lost,0
25,boy. trump is superman i guess. everything was perfect when he was leader and the world was just a peaceful happy place. i can't believe people believe this crap.,1
26,"#*""81 million people fired donald trump""* look at him!!!! he's #big madd",0
27,harris is so sharp and prepared to land blow after blow on trump. excellent.,0
28,i’ll be honest. i wasn’t expecting her to be this good. can’t believe but this is clearly a loss for trump. they are definitely regretting putting him into the stage tonight,1
27,trump is speaking to his base. kamala is speaking to americans. take a smoke break russian bots.,0
28,trump apparently gets automatic response whenever he wants.,0
29,so they’re cutting kamala off for time but letting trump ramble endlessly?,1
29,"kamala’s gaze toward trump gives “aw poor baby sweetie, bless your heart” energy 😂",1
29,let's not forget trump also threatened to withhold military aid from ukraine if they didn't investigate biden.,0
28,why doesn’t biden approve a european pipeline? does trump think biden has jurisdiction over europe?,2
28,why the fuck is trump allowed to keep talking whenever he wants? aren't the mics supposed to be muted?,2
25,does trump have a single positive message? everything is doom and gloom.,0
26,the fact that they let him get his shot in is infuriating. trump always bullies the media.,0
29,"""hey trump, what's with israel?"" ukraine and putin! she hates jews and arabs! so many people died in ukraine. the pipeline!!!!",2
25,"trump's stages of evolution during this debate: phase 1: qualuude trump - docile, on the verge of sleep phase 2: meth trump - angrily shouting final phase: ????",1
27,they are unmuting trumps mic to let him speak but i guarantee you fox news and the maga mob are going to complain about them censoring him still,1
27,trump : i’m very good friends with putin also trump : putin hopes she wins,0
27,getting called weak has really gotten under trumps skin,2
27,they are giving trump way more time to talk. he's doing his usual schtick of talking absolute shit and waves of it but talking it with confidence.,0
28,trump knows biden isn't the president of europe right?,1
28,"“thank you, mr. trump, but we have a lot of issues to get to” is probably the top quote for this thing.",0
27,“they want to do transgender surgeries on immigrants in prison” trump’s brain is jumbled up.,0
25,"yo trump is vomiting any and everything at the wall and just praying that something sticks lol. super desperate and harris is really getting under his skin with some buzzwords. very entertaining, but also a somber reminder that people believe and buy that bullshit lol",2
24,why are they letting trump talk more?,0
25,the biggest political mistake trump made was agreeing to that june debate because it forced everyone to see how bad biden was while there was time to switch him out. kamala straight up baited him throughout her campaign and she has delivered with every answer in attacking him. trump on the other hand thinks people are eating dogs.,0
26,trump is objectively getting absolutely cooked right now,2
27,kamala ending her talking points with a baiting statement is really fun to watch. so easy to get trump side tracked.,0
27,‘never stop your enemy when they’re in the middle of making a mistake’ is the strategy for harris tonight and it shows. let trump ramble. he looks pathetic.,0
27,"kamala is doing a good job just stating her points, and then luring trump to respond by going off on a rambling self destructive conspiracy tangent instead of actually answering his debate questions most times.",0
25,"it would be the funniest thing if at the end of the debate they just go ""okay so trump has talked for xx minutes longer than you harris, so we're just gonna give you that much time to speak uninterrupted"" while they wheel trump off stage",2
24,this debate is giving me so much anxiety. trump is going pretty crazy… is that because i hate the fucker that i am seeing that? and his lies? do swing voters see his acting unhinged? uuuuggggghhhhhh this is too much.,0
26,"this is painful to watch. trump doesn’t even come close to answering any of the questions, even when the host doubled down on a couple of them",2
26,trump never talks about the optimism of america. never talks about our resilience. never talks about our accomplishments. everything is just crying about how bad america is and how world war iii is imminent,1
26,"i’m surprised trump even showed up to debate her. she’s not mopping the floor with him, she’s *scrubbing* it. he’s making a fool himself and the people who support him.",0
26,my “crazy shit trump has said tonight” haiku: tim waltz kills newborns/ trans aliens in prison/ someone’s eating pets.,0
28,"trump is somehow even worse than i expected. but i am not surprised his mob will eat this up. for the people he speaks, this is acceptable.",2
27,"my non-technical analysis is that harris won the first round by emotionally defining trump on abortion as immoral and big government, deflecting on immigration enough and pivoting to her prosecutor history, and baiting trump on his crowd sizes. she looks competent and is making trump look small.",2
28,"""he has contempt for the constitution of the united states"" *trump nods*",2
29,kamala: *accurately and effectively conveying her stances in all topics raised* trump: *is actively on methamphetamines*,2
25,why tf they giving trump so much more time to talk nonsense? also is this kamala strategy to let the people hear the craziness?,0
26,@ralstonreports · 1m biden gave one of the worst debate performances in history. trump: hold my beer.,0
26,trump is such a massive bitch for not even looking at her. how weak do you need to be to look at him and see strength,0
25,bro trump is cooked lmao,2
29,if the media doesn’t cover this as kamala dismantling trump it’s going to look insane.,2
25,"reminder to the ""cut him off"" folks that harris specifically asked for trump's mic to be unmuted so everyone could how crazy and unhinged his ranting is. hence she's never complaining about his extra speaking time, and probably encouraged the moderators to allow it. the fact that trump keeps doing it is helping her.",2
30,"i do share the frustration folks are expressing about trump repeatedly getting opportunities to reply and retort to harris without her getting the same. but the way it's coming across here, she doesn't particularly *need* to. she speaks with directness and clarity the first time around, and she doesn't seem to feel the need to attack back when all he has in response is confusing, rambling misdirection.",0
30,really hope kamala's campaign pushes for more debates. trump will refuse for sure lmao,1
68,"""donald trump was fired by 81m people."" winner.",0
50,i didn’t think i could fall more in love with harris but she knows exactly how to get under his skin. when she said “trump was fired by 81 million” i knew exactly what she was doing.,0
50,"""donald trump was fired by 81 million people."" has that ever been said before? i've never heard it yet but that's perfect. it hurt him right in the place that needs to be hurt. that's a line that should be a meme, he won't sleep a wink until election day if it catches on.",0
328,"trump is burying himself. the mods i think were given instructions on basic fact checking and corrections, but his pathological lying has run so wild he is getting hit with live community notes every time he opens his mouth. feels like kamala is hardly even talking. she’s doing good at taking her opportunities to dunk on him further but she is still lowkey dodging specific policy positions",0
42,kamala is doing great. trump is imploding.,2
40,is abc going to just continue to let trump have the last word and bloviate constantly? there needs to be a limit on how much bullshit he’s allowed to spew; he’s getting more time than kamala.,0
40,"i didn’t really want to watch this debate. i’ve been chronically online and it wasn’t healthy. so happy i tuned in. kamala is hitting every note. she looks presidential, trump looks old, tired, angry, and just generally like a grandpa yelling at birds.",0
43,bots or trolls on here really be saying “idk man trump is kinda killing” with a straight face,0
24,this is trumps ‘biden moment’,1
25,conservative sub is having an absolute meltdown over trump’s performance lmao.,2
21,cut his fucking mic like the rules said they would. trump's talking time: 27 mins harris's talking time: 20 mins,2
22,did trump just use the dictator orban as a character witness??,0
23,"viktor orban is a henious person, trump. that isn't the positive for you you think it is.",0
23,why doesn’t kamala ever get to respond last? stop letting trump talk when he wants to.,0
23,calling a dictator a strongman does not mean he's a tough guy. jesus trump is an idiot,0
22,anyone who votes for trump at this point needs serious psychiatric help..,0
75,you gotta go visit the conservative sub’s live thread. they are so biased it’s hilarious. when the moderator corrected trump saying that no states allows for murder of babies after they are born…every single comment there was about how the moderator is on kamala’s side… brainless morons,2
431,transgender operations on illiegal aliens in prison. that's like the full trump bingo card right there.,0

370,i'd vote for the corpse of joe biden before i'd vote for trump so i try to be unbias... but i really struggle to think he is gaining a single independent from this performance. trump looks insane. he came out timid but he's back to himself.,0

28,trump sounds fucking insane.,0
27,ashley babbit broke into a government building with violent intentions. she got what she deserved. and trump has balls to deny his involvement with jan. 6th. he was impeached and then indicted for his role in that.,0

10,"until the utter cowards that served in his administration directly speak out, this means very little. john kelly, jim mattis, mark milley, and h.r. mcmaster need to honor their oath and speak up loudly and publicly about the danger trump poses to democracy. bill barr wants to straddle the fence and says how terrible trump was, but he was an enabler while attorney general, and says he would vote for trump again. rosen is yet another pos of a human being with no spine. mike pompeo single handedly showed what a lap\[dog he was as secretary of state in an effort to have future political ambitions. he managed to lesser america's reputation in the world, while at the same time destroying the reputations of west point and harvard graduates everywhere by having no morals. he graduated first in his class from west point and still managed to become a power seeking pos. to be fair, harvard churns out pos grads like it's their mission statement, so markedly less damage there. i want to see these generals show some of the backbone we all grew up to believe they had. be leaders, honor your oath, support democracy, and protect this nation from the threats from within ... please.",1

5,"it's not a bizarre take at all if you're progressive and you look at biden's role in elections historically. in 2016, he didn't run, but he did endorse hillary clinton, a neo-conservative, over bernie sanders, who he had said favorable things about earlier in the year. in 2020, he was supported by the dnc and traditional democrats as well, propped up by most of the other centrist democratic candidates when it became clear that sanders was performing well early in the race. he is also too old to run at the time in many people's opinion. in 2020, that only became more exacerbated, which is how we got where we are now. joe biden can be a thousand times the man trump is, and he can still be one of the last people a progressive democrat would back in any of the races he's participated in.",2

1,"hi astead, i just want to say that i was really impressed by the rfk podcast episode recently. i’ll admit that i went in with preconceived notions of what i would hear from the folks you were interviewing. in some cases, i was proven correct. however, your conversations with the auto-worker from detroit stuck out to me. her perspective was enlightening. i enjoyed listening to her frank explanations of the financial reasons that she votes the way that she does in spite of her knowledge of how her vote might impact society, her impressions of the trump rally that she attended, and her open-minded, ongoing analysis of the different candidates. i left the podcast thinking that she was smart, well-spoken, and a deep thinker. her story about the nationalism beneath the raised fists at the rally will stay with me. thanks for always sharing stories that remind me about the people within american politics. as for the ama, how do you try to keep a cool head when engaged in difficult, sometimes combative interviews? also, what’s your favorite state to visit based purely on the food?",1

5,"this is a big challenge with many politicians, but especially trump. i remember covering my first rally and being frankly overwhelmed with the amount of misinformation, which – to your point – can often make the regular forms of coverage feel inadequate. i think media has done a lot better job fact checking trump in real time, not providing an unchecked platform (in 2016 some networks were carrying his rallies live remember), and not falling for the false equivalence trap of political reporting. on the run-up, i try to make sure we have clear angles of “why” we’re covering someone, and do the prep work necessary to challenge someone factually if they’re saying something that’s not true. in some examples, like when we’ve had guest like kellyanne conway, vivek ramaswamy, or robert f. kennedy jr. we’ve taken steps like cutting in on an answer or include narration that will correct misinformation in real time.",2
13,a great example of this is when trump was recently asked about his lie about harris using ai to make it look like her crowd size was bigger. trump just flat out did not answer the question and i have not seen him be pushed on this any further. the public deserves this question to be asked until he can provide an answer on why he posted such a brazen lie.,2
15,"hey jeff! happy to answer each of these 1. i think there’s a journalistic imperative to report on both parties, but that doesn’t mean that both parties are the same or should be presented as such. i think the times understands that, and in this election specifically, has made a real effort to make sure we’re highlighting the stakes of this election, rather than living in the horse race. some examples i’d point to would be the (very early) coverage of project 2025, of trump’s increasingly radicalized rhetoric on immigration, or even an episode of the run-up that we did on the presidential debate day – where we focused on the policy differences between biden and trump on the biggest issues, and completely ignored the political theater of it all. 2. maggie is a great reporter, whose work has been essential in understanding the way donald trump and those around him make decisions. and to my earlier point about how the times has covered the stakes of this election and trump’s promises to upend the political and legal systems, maggie has been essential in that. i like that, at the times, there’s enough space to come at politics from multiple angles. so just as people like maggie give you the view from inside the campaign and candidates, our work on the run-up highlights how that is being received by the public, while the upshot provides a look via data and numbers. all parts of the puzzle matter 3. there’s a broader discussion in journalism about whether it's important to label “lies” – or call something racist. and my honest answer is that this discussion kind of misses the point. it is much harder, and more important, to do the reporting that proves something is false, or shows something is racist, rather than it is to have the nyt hold an audiences hand and label is as such. i’m more concerned about maintaining a standard of reporting that can show and not tell. i think that’s our most important journalistic function",2
5,"trump’s age and conduct is a big concern for voters that the times (and the run-up) report on all the time. it’s a big part of the reason that trump is one of the most unpopular candidates in modern times. here’s some coverage that reflects that: [~ and if you’re referring to the opinion/editorial side of the times, they have also called trump unfit to lead. here’s a link to that article [~",2
7,"thanks for listening! i’m familiar with jay rosen’s argument (though i have not read the book) and i certainly believe that as a reporter, our work requires the belief in values like free speech and the protection of the democratic process. but i also think that some people have taken that to think that media should anti-republican and pro-democrat, and that’s where i disagree. a belief in those values are the same thing that causes me to question both political parties, holding them both to account. but when i’m talking to voters, rather than politicians or people with power, i’m not looking for accountability. i’m trying to understand how they feel, and present it as clearly and honestly as possible. so yes, that’s a conscious choice. but that doesn’t mean we're airing it uncritically. in our run up episodes, there should be a clear reason you’re hearing this person’s opinion. so it’s not that we’re sharing it because “both sides are equal” we’re sharing it for a specific reason that has journalistic value. one example i think of is this episode we did from cpac, the conservative conference in dc where a lot of people were saying (falsely) that the election was stolen. why did we air it? for the important reason of showing that, for a lot of republicans, the \~only election result they trust will be one that donald trump wins. showing that has value.

(or if you don't personally think that should be her priority, what makes you think it's even a legitimate, good-faith argument?) here's a suggestion: the nyt could just pick a biden admin policy success and make it the page 1 headline. maybe you could do one such top story a week until the election. there are a lot to choose from. here's even a whole subreddit dedicated to listing them: > republicans are going to make the argument that the lack of policy specifics is because harris is a flimsy, non substantive candidate and the nyt will do its best to follow that argument up with prominent headlines supporting it, perhaps in a kind of ""just asking questions"" plausibly deniable way, despite it being total bullshit. the gop ""policy vision"" is laid out in the project 2025 manifesto, about which the nyt has run a few stories a month ago (headlines like ""what is project 2025, and why is trump disavowing it?""), but should be a front page headline every day. just go through it chapter by chapter and bam, there's your next day's headline. aside: [here's a relevant media matters story from today]( > trump national press secretary karoline leavitt criticized the media for talking “about project 2025, which has nothing to do with our campaign.” [...] leavitt herself worked on project 2025.

""harris won't tell us her policy agenda"" is nothing more or less than the latest gop talking point, all they have left after every other substance-free attack they tried is failing to stick. gop political operatives are having a hard time because inflation is down to historically normal levels; unemployment remains low; real wages are up; undocumented border crossings are down; violent crime is way down; the worst of the pandemic is over; nato is doing great; america is finally not at war for the first time in >20 years, industrial capital investment is at all time highs; dependence on foreign fossil fuels is trending downward; real retail gas prices are ordinary; the stock market is doing pretty well; women's reproductive freedom is more popular than ever; gun control has broad support; attacking gay and trans people isn't driving regular people to the polls; etc. the few places where people are unhappy with the administration, such as israel's war in gaza being a shit-show or the us not doing enough about climate change, the gop is coming from the wrong side to make the argument. with biden at the top of the ticket they had 2 main attacks – joe biden's age and hunter biden – but now that biden is out, they have nothing. for the nyt and other media outlets to uncritically parrot this latest weak attack is just more of the same pro-gop-tilted coverage we've come to expect over the past decade(s). after spending months attacking ""biden's bad vibes"", the nyt and other outlets are shocked that harris is suddenly winning on the vibes front, and are desperate to find some other angle.",1
80,"when i used to work with dementia patients, it was extremely important to keep their surroundings and their routine as regular and familiar as possible. they simply do not adapt well to changing situations, even minor ones. trump is exhibiting an extreme inability to cope with the new reality of biden dropping out and harris taking over. add to that the fact that she is accelerating in popularity, and his plaque-addled brain just cannot process what is happening or how to handle it. i said many months ago that i would be surprised if he makes it to november, and i have not seen any reason yet to feel differently.",0
92,this is not a good framing. trump has never been attached to reality he has only ever asserted *his* reality. sometimes it is more or less coherent than another time but it always follows the basic premise that he is indomitable and strong and everyone else needs to cater to him. that hasn't changed any even if he's becoming less able to communicate it.,0
19,"pick a decade where trump was attached to reality (i can't easily find one): * the problem we have is we don’t have any protection for the policeman. the problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights – unbelievable rights. - 1989 * you know, it doesn't really matter what they write as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass. - 1991 * all of the women on the apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. that's to be expected. 2004 * the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive. - 2012 * this is a fraud on the american public. this is an embarrassment to our country. we were getting ready to win this election. frankly, we did win this election - 2020",0

1,"trump is very much in control. there is a difference between someone who has lost it, and someone who never had it. trump has been able to bullshit and baffle his way through life by just spewing nonstop. he has separated himself from those who try to inject reality into the situation. he leveraged his lack of morals to avoid real consequences for his actions by always doubling down. the only difference between pre and post-kamala trump is he is back in the throw shit at the wall phase. he normally finds something that sticks and just repeats it, but the hits aren't hitting anymore.",0
10,"agreed. trump has the thinnest skin imaginable (old people's skin naturally starts thinning on its own too so it's just getting worse) and the fact of the matter is that kamala is his superior in every possible way. she's playing him like a fiddle and it's helping along his self-imposed implosion. he's a horrible, fragile, criminal manchild and she's in an entirely different league.",0

(as they should be). world-wide inflation increased after the world came out of covid, and supply chains couldn’t deliver the goods fast enough. just compare the rest of the world’s inflation with the us’s. ours was very tame, and yes, it is now down to 3%. trump’s economy, on the other hand, was in the covid recession with 10% unemployment rates. not to mention his anti-science covid stance likely killed hundreds of thousands more than necessary. one thing i won’t stand for, is someone who attacks science (and is ignorant of it). inflation adjusted gas prices are a little high, but not as high as in the 70’s, or between 2006-2014. this may be related to the world’s booming economies and the ukrainian war. would you rather have low gas prices in a recession? again, they are coming down.",1

69,"from the article: >to hear former president donald j. trump tell it, he has just been heartsick over all that has happened to poor old president biden these past few weeks. >“the presidency was taken away from joe biden,” mr. trump said at a news conference at mar-a-lago, his private club and residence in palm beach, fla., on thursday afternoon. “i’m not a fan of his, as you probably have noticed. he had a rough debate. but that doesn’t mean that you just take it away like that.” >it has been 18 days since the 46th president was shoved aside by his own party, and the 45th president has yet to get over it. he agonized on mr. biden’s behalf, telling a tale of treachery perpetrated against him by former president barack obama, former house speaker nancy pelosi and, most of all, vice president kamala harris. >“for some reason, and i know he regrets it — you do, too — he picked her,” mr. trump said. “and she turned on him, too. she was working with the people that wanted him out.” (mr. biden endorsed ms. harris for president 27 minutes after he dropped out of the race.) >there was none of the usual, malicious glee in mr. trump’s voice as he rehashed all the drama. he told reporters that mr. biden was trying to “put up a good face” but that his exit from the race was “pretty severe” and “pretty horrible.” >“i hate to be defending him,” mr. trump said, “but he did not want to leave. he wanted to see if he could win.” >just two days ago, mr. trump was wondering aloud on social media if there might be any chance that mr. biden would crash the democratic national convention in chicago later this month to try to “take back the nomination, beginning with challenging me to another debate.” >was he was speaking from experience when he said mr. biden was “not happy with any of the people that told him, ‘you’ve got to leave’”? >“he’s a very angry man right now,” mr. trump said. “i can tell you that.”",0
24,"that's because a few things happened. 1. after the debate, all the focus was on biden. trump didn't get all that much attention and everyone's response was ""par for the course and trump was just a bully..."" buuuuuuuuut \*solid 2 weeks of media attention on biden\*. trump got a huge boost but end of the day, he \*needs\* to be the center of attention. 2. he got shot at. it immediately seemed like a lock that he would win. he was likely on cloud 9 because the polls and everything heavily swung in his direction. he believed everything was now locked in with a full strategy and coasting to an easy win. 3. less than a week later, biden withdraws and immediately endorses harris which removes any chance of party infighting...biden has the delegates and while he may not have been happy being shown the door, by making that declaration, he effectively sealed the nomination for harris which let her hit the ground running. this immediately sucked all the air away from the trump campaign. no one expected biden to step aside, media just wanted to push that narrative because it got clicks and made for juicy clips. 4. harris turning the vp search into a media spectacle with so many choices then pulled even more air away from trump and his flaccid choice in vance. this one stung particularly bad for trump. he got outmaneuvered and is now stuck with a running mate he doesn't even like because of ego. the trump campaign is now stuck with a series of arguments which no longer work and are now even more effective against their campaign and they don't have a clear or engaging way to move forward just yet. trump is experiencing the whiplash of being on cloud 9 one minute with an easy win in sight to possibly losing not only to a minority woman, but also never being able to beat joe biden in an election, and upon losing that election facing multiple looming trials from 2020 which are delayed because of this election. his strategy was to stall stall stall and then win the election so those charges get dropped/buried. it's hard to do that if you lose.",0
38,"trump knows that biden dropping out was about beating him. it's beyond his comprehension that biden would give up and support a totally different candidate. harris reminds him if obama and trump has never gotten over obama. he's afraid of being embarassed by someone he considers beneath him. not just a minority, but a woman, too. in his fantasy rant from a few days ago he mentions obama.",0

3,"someone yesterday made a good point. democrats are ok with biden stepping down because we vote as a party. the policies are the party, not the person. trump can't step down because he is the party. it's all republicans have. they don't have policy. they have trump. and it's why they are in full panic mode. they have nothing to shift too. the only move they have is having vance step aside. but even that is hard because it makes trump look bad. and thus the party. biden stepping aside was ok, because again we are not voting for a person. we are voting for policy. it's why my neighbors house is covered in trump flags and mine isn't covered with biden flags. the republicans can't understand this which is why they were so surprised that the party rallied behind harris so quickly. it's why trump is trying to push the narrative that biden was ""pushed out"" they are trying to build the narrative that democrats care more about the person and they didn't like biden so fuck democracy and kick him out. but it's not working because again. it's about the policy to us. we wanted biden to step down because we knew if he loses, our policies are destroyed. if trump stands down, the identity of the republican party is destroyed. so it can't happen.",1
2,lol. trump could be down 30 and he wouldn’t dream of walking away.,0
1,trump is barely campaigning anymore because there are 70 election officials in swing states who will refuse to certify any victory for harris. trump has explicitly been declaring “we dont need the votes” and georgia has already been changing its election procedures for this. this election is not about “winning” or “or appealing to swing voters “or turnout” any more and the more we and the media keep focusing on standard but now irrelevant horse race crap the closer we are to a coup.,0
85,so...trump is now weirdly cosplaying as a psychic who can magically read president biden's mind to know what he is feeling.,2
13,"this ""argument"" has no merit because we all watched trump also try to take the presidency from biden.",2
9,"trump regrets how the first debate went. his showing of coming off with energy (albeit a stream of lies) against biden's age is what started turning the wheels on all this change. now he's facing a challenge he was not expecting, is unprepared for and frankly i don't believe he thinks he can win.",0
3,>the trump campaign is now stuck with a series of arguments which no longer work and are now even more effective against their campaign and they don't have a clear or engaging way to move forward just yet. it's almost as if they have no popular policy goals and instead their only objective is to beat democrats.,0
6,"then they should have done that the day biden was inaugurated- strength in numbers, right. gd mcconnell- he is old, and evil, and because of him we are stuck with trump. the gop should have cut him off at the knees after 1/6.",1
3,"he's not used to a person taking responsibility either. and what he absolutely hates is that the other side now uses his own idea of lies, lies, lies against him. like that couch story. it's not true, but not everybody knows that, and by repeating it over and over again it becomes true in the minds of the idiots. biden wasn't capable and willing to beat trump with his own weapons. kamala is willing to do what it takes.",0
9,"> it’s like the presidency has turned into a reality tv show, and we’re all unwilling participants. trump and the republicans did that.",0
7,the headline of the article is tongue-in-cheek... it's written as if from trump's perspective. you can tell from the first sentence that is an editorial choice.,2
2,"yep. i’m still blown away that they didn’t choose some other candidate. the rnc must be filled with a bunch of p*ssies because trump has clearly grabbed them all- gop voters, what the hell were you thinking? haley would have skated to victory.",0
1,"from some point in 2021 until about 2023, i feel like we didn't have a lot of trump in the media. he was still in the background but he wasn't focused on as much. i'm hoping once this election is over and he loses, this interest in him will die down again.",2
254,other republicans can’t have him step down either. a sizable portion of his base will reject the republican party for forcing trump out of it and stay home. they have to carry him to term,0
4,"so true.. unfortunately it’s really the only purpose he’s going thru with all this. id hate to be a big gop donor who has to eventually reckon with the fact that they blindly gave their money and effort to a guy who specifically had no goal of winning the election, but rather evading arrest. he literally said “fuck everybody! i’m running again!” my honest prediction is that he knows that theres a federal investigation out there (one that was ultimately quashed by his ag bill barr) that has the potential to put him behind bars for life. apparenly back in 2016, like 10 days before election day, iran straight up gave trump a hidden $10 million chunk of cash, which he immediately deposited only to turn around and write his own campaign a personal check from his own bank account for exactly $10million.. so he basically smuggled a 10 million iranian donation into his campaign thru his own personal bank account right before election day.. and go figure, the feds immediately started a super confidential investigation about it from the start of his presidency.. it lasted for like 2 years or something.. and eventually after running thru a few disloyalists.. he finally found his savior in bill barr… now it sounds like this story is really gaining more traction again and i bet it’s only adding to his desperation… so yeah. i’ll be waiting to hear how fox news spins this one around.",0
3,legit question: what happens if trump ceased living via natural causes?,2
17,"as a liberal, i wouldn't piss on ron desantis if he were on fire, but yeah. he would have gotten republicans all of the trump maga policies without the baggage and unhinged personality.",0
2,"~~kristi~~ nikki haley. she got like, 20% of the vote. ron got less than 2%. though if trump wasn't in the picture, his votes wouldn't have proportionately gone to nikki. still, i imagine that ""trump's shitty policies but with somehow far less charisma"" wouldn't have pulled enough votes. a lot of the trump or die voters might have just stayed home for the primaries.",0
2,"if they wanted to stick with trumpism, run tucker carlson. if they used normal calculus, they'd run kristi noem, or brian kemp, or mike dewine. your standard issue governor, if they are from a swing state its a bonus. if they wanted to turn towards normalcy, run adam kinzinger or charlie baker. if you wanted a real out of left field pick, i wonder how phil scott (governor of vermont) would do. he's the most popular governor in america, and he's a republican from a deeply blue state. phil scott/tim scott would be amusing just from a name standpoint. also random thing i learned while looking up approval ratings, wyoming republicans are really popular. the governor and both senators are near the top of approval ratings.",0
8,"keep in mind… trump is capable of empathy. especially if it pertains to his own survival or prestige. he just really hates using it and is fucking bad at it. like a couch potato at the gym bad. the easiest people to empathize with are people like us - same skin colour, same sexuality, same class level, same gender, same age, same view on life, same values, same tribe, etc. each category that differs makes it harder. biden, despite his difference in moral and political takes, is very relatable to don. he is a white, straight, rich octogenarian man holding the office of president, fighting to retain it. - check he has been told to step down - check he’s been accused of cognitive decline - check and he has stepped down and been replaced by a younger, brown woman. 🤯🤯🤯 this is a direct threat to donnie’s world view and survival, if it can happen to biden, it can happen to him. so yeah, he truly believes he *knows* what biden is going through, coz he’s the only one who is that close to him in likeness - or so he believes. its his worst nightmare - to be publicly humiliated by your own loyalists like that snd have all your narc supply confiscated, only to have it be given to a brown woman, who is supposed to be your lackey?? and keep in mind, donnie needs to win this to stay out of prison. his life is literally on the line. oddly, biden along with the threat to his life mightve just blown life into his atrophied empathy muscle. its partly why he feels for biden and wants him to come back - its like snatching away his safety blanket. and not just coz he felt he could’ve beaten biden more easily. because the thought of being replaced for the same reasons, or even losing to a female obama is too much to bear.",0
14,"this is the fundamental problem. if this strategy were to work, the claims that she was “crowned” by the dnc would would have had at least some teeth in the first week of her candidacy(when people were still adjusting to the idea of him stepping down, and there were still rumblings of an open convention). even at that point, there was nothing there and everyone was on the same page in accepting her as our candidate. it’s part of why where we are right now is borderline miraculous. and now? after the hype train for harris has left the station, and walz has turned out to be a smash-hit vp….it just comes across as pathetic wishful thinking on trump's part. simply put, basically no one was a ride or die biden supporter.",1
23,i was a ride or die biden fan and the idea there would be more democrats than could fit into a phone booth is idiotic. harris is the best chance to wreck trump and there is nothing more motivational to democrats than to watch trump having a sobbing psychotic breakdown when a black woman whips him once and for all.,0
1,"lmao. people who say this don't know anything about how the primary process works. the dnc had literally no hard leverage over biden. he had the pledged delegates. the pledged delegates can't vote for anyone else since he won the primary unless joe releases them. the only thing they could do is threaten to withhold funding, to which he can say ""and ensure trump wins? be serious now."" i've seen republicans push the weirdest theories, like his own cabinet threatening to invoke the 25th amendment out of fear that he'd lose reelection but somehow not knowing that this would kill his chances against trump and thus is a toothless threat. it's what i imagine sauron would've said trying to explain why aragorn never took the ring. it can't be that he's a good man who wants something more than just power, no, there had to be some stronger force preventing him from taking it because no man would willingly give up power when offered to him.",1
50,"tim miller from bulwark made a montage of all the times at the presser where trump couldn't hear, something like a dozen or so.",2
17,"“today donald trump received three more irr denials from admin as well as a written warning about the possible consequences of abusing the grievance process. also, he was shanked again, but the sharpened tooth brush handle did not fully penetrate the outer fatty tissue, so the former president was not sent on medical outcount and is expected to make a full recovery. “",0
137,"worse part for them is when he loses he will inevitably cry fraud again even if it's a massive blue texas/florida blow out. so once again, they will have to pretend they won, and why would you move on from someone who won. trump family members or close loyalists now control all the finances and infrastructure of the gop as well. so even if the wanted to move on they can't. lindsey graham was remarkably prophetic saying trump would destroy the republican party. i think they are heading for destruction like the long dead whigg party. if trump looses, they might actually try to nominate him from prison in 2028. and once he's gone they are going to tear themselves into pieces because they don't actually have any policy positions tying them together anymore.",1

3,"i’m with you 100%. i’m not saying it’ll work. i’m saying their game is in the margins. anything to flub the numbers and knock the results out of true helps them. even if they can get just enough lingering biden supporters to offset the tens of people rfk is siphoning off trump’s base, that’s a win for them.",0
12,exactly. we don’t “know.” it’s entirely possible he could have received health news that‘s not great. it’s entirely possible his family said they didn’t want to go through this anymore and they just want him to have as much time with them as he can in his last years. it’s entirely possible he came down with covid and decided his priorities have changed. it’s entirely possible he decided he couldn’t give the campaign what it needed and decided to step aside to give the country its best shot at defeating trump. we don’t “know.” trump sure as shit doesn’t know and this sudden sympathy act is shameful and ridiculous. it’s only motivated by his sudden fear that maybe he’s too fucking old and that he’ll get supplanted himself. every accusation is a projection. eta: oh and fuck the nyt.,0

17,"provided we get out of this without a trump dictatorial monarchy hellscape: i don’t think any of them have it in them to drive interest from the people needed to win a primary. trump is going to leave a stain so rotten that it’ll stick to everyone he kept in his orbit. they’ve been raised to network well with billionaires and sit in the uncanny valley for everyone else. the opportunistic ghouls have been lying in wait for the trump show to end. first clear change they get, we’re going to have rubio, ryan, christie, and at least one of the full maga congresspeople clawing for a chance at the resolute desk.",1

95,that place is a hyperbolic coping chamber. they just commiserate and stew and tilt at windmills together all day long. any good news for the country is downvoted or made to sound like it's actually terrible. anything bad that happens to the country is celebrated as heralding the return of trump.,0
49,"they still wouldn't vote for them over trump. all they wanted was for democrats to be divided, and now they're worried it wont happen.",0
93,"i think a lot of the crucial swing voters who voted for both obama and trump are vibes people. and walz is a good vibes guy, in addition to being a good policy guy. he’s very likable and authentic.",0
662,"is that a passage from trumps new book, the art of the shart?",0
106,trump already tweeted about it saying walz is a west coast wannabe or some shit. basically trying to tie him to california elites. he’s from a town of 400 people in nebraska lmao come on man,2
53,thats funny considering vance and trump's history with west and east coast elites and both coming from ivy league schools.,2
100,"good. remember: it is possible for people to be charged and subsequently found not guilty at a trial. **that possibility is why there is a trial**. when these people argue that charges should be dismissed against trump, they're not arguing that he's innocent. they're arguing it should not be possible to try him in a court of law. these slimy fucks know his cases are slam dunks. they don't want the cases dismissed because they think he's innocent, but because they know he is guilty.",0
31,"trump's tried to cheat in every election he's been in so far, and when that didn't work out he cheered on an armed coup in which 3 people were murdered. he belongs in prison and his loyalists should be barred from politics.",2
4,i greatly appreciate trump finding creative ways to delay this trial until he was facing a former prosecutor and state attorney general as his political opponent. really helps bring the contrast into focus. 🤣,2
6,"i’ll have you know the contents of that trumpster are private! you stick your nose in, you’ll be violating attorney-trumpster confidentiality.",0
2,damn that headline was hard to parse! i think i got it now: it's a good thing. trial will go ahead despite trump whining about it being unfair.,0
8,but they're airing all his dirty laundry. it's a trumpster fire.,0
281,trump talks out of his ass about things he doesn’t understand in order to appear smart. fixed the headline,2
123,"i keep seeing this phrasing in headlines about this that he ""has economists stumped."" it's a dump and deceptive way of phrasing it. it implies ""well because trump said it obviously it's true, but even economists can't figure out his genius 5d chess calculus"" the correct phrasing would be ""donald trump's plan to hoard billions in bitcoin has economists calling trump stupid and weird""",0
118,so... trump wants to use us government money to inflate the value of bitcoin owned by his criminal friends? does that sound about right?,2
3,"i don't understand much about bitcoin, but hearing trump talk about it shows me that he understands *way less* than i do about it.",2

1,there’s a trump supporter born every minute.,0
1,"he is bonkers. this would push the value up - he probably has many. then the currency would crash. it would be bad for the us. just another way to scam the us public. recall that trump has a history of fraud, and dodgy-dealing. and of losing lots of money..",0
1,cause it doesn’t. the effect would be to prop up the price of bitcoin to make his new crypto bro friends richer. also i’m sure that trump would buy a ton of bitcoin himself prior to the government going on a bitcoin buying spree.,2
1,not a coincidence that our own little trump wannabe over in canada brought up replacing the canadian dollar with bitcoin 🙄,0
1,">“for too long, the government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: never sell your bitcoin,” said trump during his speech on saturday, the whole ""never sell"" mantra is such an odd concept. what's the point of never realizing a profit on an investment or speculation (aside from collectibles or art that have some value in being held and enjoyed)?",2

-1,"crooks like trump are the exact reason bitcoin and its like should be banned. zero redeeming social value, only gives harbor to criminals",2
13,he accumulates grifts to swindle the undereducated. that's all. selling shoes is a grift. stockpiling bitcoin is a grift. there's no part of donald trump that isn't some grift or con that preys upon the undereducated.,0
4,no that’s elon. trump is worse. he just repeats the last thing the latest groveling donor said to him.,0
1,trump is just playing to the bitcoin bro crowd for their vote,0
3,"yep, but ""trump's plan to do what he's been paid (*) to do by other crooks has people stumped."" isn't much of a headline. there's no sense of mystery there to keep people reading. it's for personal, not national benefit, of course. (*) not in bitcoin.",0

2,the whole trump family is pretty heavily into nfts; i wouldn't be a bit surprised if they hold beaucoup cryptos.,0
1,he wants the cryptobros to *donate* them to him. it's definitely a [real plan;]( the trump campaign has been accepting cryptos since april. kamala should be doing likewise.,2

9,"which raises the obvious question: where did trump even hear of bitcoin, much less plan some complicated nonsensical strategy that serves to legitimize bitcoin and bitcoin alone?",2
1,"nah, there's some credit that should be given to trump here. i mean, not anything detailed - but there are people like bannon and co that would have pointed out to him that they can move money around more freely - so trump can receive money, and they can get money to their causes, without the legal oversight and tracking as to who gets the money. whilst it's all done in plain sight. so whilst trump may not understand the intricacies, he'll understand that it means more money coming in for him, and more money to pay people illicitly to do his bidding. and he'll be okay with that.",0
2,"trump: “those beautiful bitcoin miners, great guys by the way, they are so brave! down in their tunnels underground, getting all the bitcoins, it’s very commendable, very dangerous. they are heroes.”",0

3,"agree, people who think gop is better for economy are usually mistaking stocks for economy. trump mostly cares about juicing the market, short term movement, they don't care if it reverses later because they'll just short sell when that happens- finance/traders like market volatility more than they like a healthy economy.",0

42,> trump is going to lose to a black woman that'll trigger the chuds!,0

27,"i know it's sick and wrong of me, but there's a small, rotten corner of my brain that wants him to just keep running for president every four years and losing until the time comes that he's comparing field notes with satan. the longer the republicans go without a real primary and a real election and a real president, the worse their long-term future looks like. at this point, the republicans have not had an actual republican president in office for the past 15 and a half years (as in, someone who legitimately cares about the fate of the republican party), and they won't for another four and half years even in a best-case-scenario for them. trump and his ilk obviously do plenty of damage on their own, but at some point there just won't be a place for the old republicans who knew how to at least be more subtle and sly about their horrible ways. he's destroying the party and pushing out the ones who know how to play the game effectively as a result. the country is worse off in the short term for having to endure it, but people like liz cheney and paul ryan having no party to call home and no leverage to build a case for their own presidential ambitions in the future is going to leave a massive generational hole in their minor leagues. the damage trump has wrought on the republican party is going to really be felt in the 2030s, when he's dead and things could theoretically be back to normal for them, because they'll have so many mtgs and boeberts and gaetzes and so few romneys and jeff flakes.",0

5,they don't have anyone else. i can't wait to see what the republican party looks like after this next 4 years. a large majority of their base wants trump and no one else. they are going to lose so much engagement they may just never win another election ever. all because they tied everything to the orange con man.,0
65,"they can try, but none of his kids have *it*. whatever…thing…that draws those people to donald trump cannot be replicated. there is only him. and it’s going to be a very painful learning experience for conservatives once he dies or is otherwise incapable of running. they’ve run him at a national level for three elections straight, and no one could even remotely get traction against him this time even after his previous failure. not even someone like desantis who people ignorantly thought was “trump but better (aka worse)”. not even close.",0

4,one issue they may have is that many states have rules that parties must name a candidate within a certain number of days after the convention. dems haven't had their convention yet which is why biden could drop out but the gop had theirs and trump would have to be the name on a lot of state ballots. the gop was even hoping to sue states to force biden's name on ballots but most legal experts say he dropped out in time. there are exceptions for if a candidate dies though. which is why i was so suspicious when trump was shot at and biden got covid within a few days of each other. lol,2

25,that's okay. i think trump is stupid all the time,0
5,technically he cannot be forced out for medical reasons. he can choose to step down. however if hes incapacitated the vp just becomes president. the party could make the choice that he not run for a second term. and stop backing him. thats more along the lines of what happened because trump created a weakness they want to exploit. younger politicians are something i have yearned for in my lifetime and it will be interesting to see that play out.,0

11,"trump got away with skipping the republican debates, and with the cult the republican party has turned into, i doubt he'd pay for skipping the main event with his base, but i sure hope uncommitted voters take note (though i honestly have trouble understanding people who aren't part of the cult vs those who see the orange menace for what he is). however, even with an absentee debater, you have to be careful of things like the infamous clint eastwood yelling at an empty chair. heck, joe would probably still be our nominee if he hadn't pushed for an early debate (2020's was held at the end of september). anyway, my point is that, if trump ducks all debates, democrats will have to be at least a little careful to lambast him about it without turning it into a surreal show. also, i think harris made a mistake not accepting the fox offer for a debate (which i think she has given her comments about sticking to the agreement biden had with trump on debates). fox does, despite itself, have a few alright people for hosting purposes, and i *think* that every time harris gets in a face to face with trump she'll dominate (i recall thinking she really nailed the debate with pence, though the fly certainly helped). plus, we know there's a large portion of the us that only watches fox (god have mercy of their souls), so this might have been the only chance to get real time in front of those people. i guess we'll see.",0

15,"flip that too, though. for every person who was hating biden's age, trump is literally just as old, he is now the oldest candidate in history, beating biden's nomination year. you cannot say biden is old but trump is fine, you can't even say trump speaks well anymore, he comes across as every bit of as demented as he portrays joe biden is when he goes to a debate, gets a question about the climate, and spends 3 and 1/2 minutes talking about the immigrants. then when he gets a question on immigration policy, he goes off about how joe biden is going to pay putin for a prisoner exchange or something. man is so consumed by his own vitriol that he cannot consider action without in the same breath disparaging and singling out others he has perceived as somehow less than him. he couldn't even respond to biden checking on him after the shooting without shooting his mouth back about how it was a dem plant or something in the aftermath",0
14,even at his worst moments biden was coherent and showed much greater mental acuity than trump. you're confusing mental capacity for energy. trump could whip himself up and spin all kinds of nonsense. biden just looked older because he was slower and softer. being an old guy doesn't mean having dementia.,0
9,dementia is hard to understand i guess. trump would do good by the nation to step down.,0
18,yeah. polling showed that he would lose to trump. so he stepped down in order to make sure trump doesn't win aka put america first.,1
6,polling has yet to take into consideration that she is now the presumptive nominee. she was merely a hypothetical candidate in prior polls and she was still within a few percentage points of trump. factor in the notoriety that comes with being the likely candidate (as well as not being biden or trump) polling is likely to change dramatically.,2
5,"so why is the gop trying to sue over it? why does trump want every dollar of his campaign money that he spent back if it's not so he has a fighting chance against kamala? who apparently has absolutely no chance, unless you actually look at what the gop and their glorious leader are trying to do to stop her.",0

2,"i think that one of the great american tragedies, and i'm seeing a lot of this on social media, is that a lot of trumpers attribute trump's worst impulses to biden. they think that's just how presidents act; that all presidents are dictatorial, authoritarian, power-mad, profit-centered, and undemocratic, and their choice of trump just means they want the person who can do that better than anyone else. the idea of sacrifice just does not occur to them. as a result, i'm seeing some utterly bizarre takes on social media, especially twitter. i've seen a lot of maga conservatives say things along the lines of ""i don't get it; how does this help biden?"" (not a direct quote.) they're inventing some of the most bizarre conspiracy theories to try to fit ""biden steps down for the good of the nation; harris steps up to top the ticket and quickly earns enough delegates for the nomination"" into ""biden is a grasping, single-minded dictator who wants to destroy the country,"" and it doesn't fit.",1

8,"real, my parents tried to tell me the other day that we need to vote for the president that will fix the economy and that’s why they were voting for trump, as if his policies haven’t caused some of our economic issues now. not to mention they also tried to say that he would keep the corporations under control to prevent them from inflation, which i highly doubt.",2
5,i voted for trump twice. it wasn't until he lost the last election and went psycho that i realized what he really was. it is time for us conservatives to take back our beloved republican party and put it in the hands of actual conservatives with actual ideas. the democrats just put the adults back in charge. and it is time we do the same.,1
12,when trump was shot he got hit on the ear so naturally he had a band aid on it a good chunk of his cult decided to larp as gun shot victims in solidarity with their cult. saw it at the rnc,2
9,"that's the unfortunate truth. i think biden would have made a fantastic president for the next 4 years, however i don't think he was beating trump so the point is moot.",0
2,"i agree with you that an opposition is important, but the republican party has gone too far to be a good one. i don't see things getting better politically in the usa unless the current ideology embraced by the republican party completely implodes on itself. if that happens, i think/hope a new political party would form, probably from the current anti-trump republicans and a few of the more conservative-leaning democrats.",1
48,i’m afraid it’s going to take a lot more than trump losing this election for the republican party to come to its senses. they’ve been barreling towards extremism since long before trump. they’ve outright admitted that their policies are unpopular and the only way they can win elections is to suppress the vote and use gerrymandering. they would rather cheat than try to win over new voters with more popular policy.,0
32,"i truly wish i could move back to the independent i consider myself to be however the damage trump has done to the republican party is not something i think i can move on from they are running a man who violently raped at least one child but who knows how many . the rest is bad from traitor to the constitution to the being a felon thing but the child thing is what deals it for me . even if he loses how tf is one supposed to pretend that kind of depravity wasn’t in full display … it’s so morally bankrupt, i am horrified at people i thought i knew better .",0
2,"i hope you keep an eye on p2025, vance, thiel, musk, heritage, federalist society and others behind the scenes. trump is just their tool for capturing the angry crowds' vote and leave them with zero responsibility how to use the gifted powers. mark my words - they'd surely love getting another, less repulsive tool for the same purpose after trump.",0
2,i'm not sure they'll ever reject him or his ilk. lara trump is in charge of the rnc now. his family owns the party. i think the sane among you need to break off *en masse* and form a new party. that's the only way you're escaping the trumps at this point.,1
4,"yeah, i agree, and i really hope you're able to take back your party soon. i say this as a democrat, but it seems like trump is not a true conservative in many ways that matter; he wants a lot of drastic, systemic changes that don't line up with traditional conservatism and american values. i get the initial appeal in 2016 (anti-establishment etc) but now...he has gone way off the deep end in some really scary ways. wishing for better representation for y'all in the near future.",0
3,the fact that trump is a viable candidate after his last 4 years does not say anything good about our country.,0
109,"as a atheist who thinks the bible is just a bunch of bronze age fairy tales, trump made me reconsider the existence of god. clearly the bible is on to something about the anti-christ, for there is no other explanation on how someone who is the living manifestation of the seven deadly sins and a routine violator of all 10 commandments could command this level of support with ""christians"". edit: i am just amazed how many people below seem to need to attack biden's willingness to leave. i might agree in any other year, but trump lower the bar on presidential power grabbing to basically six feets under. biden could had done a ton more hold on to power and go full trump 2020, with supreme court ""immunity"" to boot, but he choose not to, and that is enough.",1
38,"yeah, i mean just look at the last republican president before trump in bush. do i believe his tenure was worse for the country than if gore or kerry had been president? absolutely. do i think it was due to malice? no, i think he had the country's best interests at heart, but i think he was wrong. no way you can say the same for trump.",0
14,the fact that they all outwardly endorse trump is enough proof to me that the entire national party is rotten to its core.,2
20,maybe not entirely. purging his cult from the party will take years. but losing this election will force the more pragmatic republicans to face reality. donald trump is a loser. he got lucky in one election. either correct course or for face a long drought of both voter support and donors.,0
5,"it's tough, dude. i think of the trump woman who screamed, ""he's not hurting the right people!"" and she fits the bill to an extent. then i think of my conservative family in rural america, and some are in a strict patriarchy, which is about power, and some are just very ignorant, so it definitely exists. but the ignorant ones are victims of the powerful ones. they've already had their realities manipulated. i'll never forget when they unironically talked about kitty litter being put in their local high school for kids who identify as furries. they were so incredulous towards ""woke,"" that they perpetuated the power-hungry lies. dangerous times for our democracy.",0
11,"after i read this and saw these 'christians' hugging and kissing the golden calf i knew their faith is all bs. its just a cosplay and the bible is the script. they're determined to make us live out this death fantasy with them. they pluck rules out of the book to run 'our' lives and ignore what they don't like. if they cant see this statue as the 'golden calf' and be horrified at it. its all garbage. actors with a deathwish. trump is human garbage, but he's their god!? gtfoh",1
15,"i don't see anything weird about that. those are the people who believe the bible is a historical document written by god himself, and sheepishly blindly follow authority. don't expect them to notice that trump is more like anti-christ than anyone else. and the antichrist description is also easy to make - just describe a total psychopath, and obviously such a person would damn the entire world if given absolute power.",0
7,"> as a atheist who thinks the bible is just a bunch of bronze age fairy tales, trump made me reconsider the existence of god. [you might find this article interesting and terrifying.](",2
24,"everyone said that was going to happen when the ""red wave"" failed to appear at the midterms. every trump endorsed candidate lost and 'bigly'. the conservative sub was ripe and full of talking about how trump was a loser and an anchor and they needed to move on. then a week went by and they forgot all about it and went back to worship. i'd be a little bit more concerned that you're being a bit too optimistic, if i'm being honest.",1
3,at this point i think separating trumpism from the republican party is like trying to remove the flour from a cake after you've baked it.,0
3,i am absolutely convinced that putin has a video of trump fucking an underage russian ballerina or something equally disgusting.,0
4,"this time it is different. because trump himself is running. if he fails to deliver yet again, the party will turn on him. it helps that if he loses this time he is likely going to prison. there will be nowhere left for him to hide. and we will have a president will not be shy about prosecuting him.",0
15,">this time it is different. because trump himself is running. if he fails to deliver yet again, the party will turn on him. no, they won't. the only way they will is if the \*people\* turn on him, their constituents, and since trump and much of the gop leadership has strangled your voters in to believing *every fucking stupid thing* that comes out of his mouth, even losing another election if anything will embolden him and his followers further to think they are victims and the system is rigged against them. they've threatened civil war and violence and more. ""this time it is different"" - said everybody the last time.",0
2,"just being real with you, at this point you need a whole new party/name. there's just too much baggage now, which is why everyone uses the term ""hijacked"" when it comes to trump and the republican/gop platform. you will never get the historical stink off of being a ""conservative"" or a republican. even if you get rid of trump, plenty of ""moderate republican"" views are flat out not compatible with modern, progressive society. your party is dead.",0
2,do we really need a whole article for every dumb opinion trump says?,0
1,coming from trump that is an honor,2
1,"if biden were to drop his pants and take a shit on the sidewalk, it’d be national news but if he did it every day for three years straight, the thousandth time he did it wouldn’t get covered everyone is so thoroughly accustomed to trump being such a dumbass relentless dickhole, it would only be newsworthy if he did something out of character like hug a homeless person or call tiffany by name",0
1,"hmmmm…big deal, hillary had more money than trump and was ahead in the polls and she lost.",0
